SonATA Versions.

2/12/09 dx-1_00. Tagged for all of sonata-pkg.  First compilable/linkable
	version of DX1.  Major changes from DX0 (sonata demo).  Not runnable,
	has many known bugs and some functionality disabled, but usable for
	testing front end.
2/12/09 dx-1_01.  Tagged for dx only.  Result of initial testing, checkpoint
	tag so that namespace changes can be made.
2/12/09 channel-0_28.  Tagged for channelizer only.  Changed namespace from
	sonata_channelizer to channelizer with eclipse refactoring facility.
2/12/09 dx-1_02. Tagged for dx only.  Changed namespace from sonata_dx to dx.

2/13/09 spectra-0_17.  Tagged for spectraLib only.  Changed namespace from
	spectra_lib to spectra.
2/13/09 sonata-0_01.  Tagged for all sonata-pkg.  Namespace changes.
2/13/09 sonataLib-0_07.  Tagged for sonataLib only.  Changed typedef
	complex* to	Complex*.
2/13/09 channel-0_29.  Tagged for channelizer only.  Changed typedef
	complex* to	Complex*.
2/13/09 dx-1_03.  Tagged for dx only.  Changed typedef complex* to Complex*.
2/13/09 packetgen-1_25.  Tagged for packetgen only.  Changed typedef
	complex* to	Complex*.
2/13/09 sonata-0_02.  Tagged for all sonata-pkg.  Changed typedef
    complex* to Complex* using eclipse refactor.

2/21/09 sonata-0_03.  Tagged for all sonata-pkg.  Changed namespace
	dx_lib to dx.  Front end of dx (packet handling, spectrometry)
	is mostly working.  Added filters directory and a number of
	new filters.
2/24/09 dx-1_04.  Tagged for dx only.  Rearranged Activity, Channel and
	State so that function organization makes more sense.  Added Hz or
	MHz to bandwidth functions, Usable to subchannel/bin functions.
3/3/09 daddLib-0_01.  Tagged for daddLib only.  Initial version, appears
	to work.  Provides only top-down DADD.
3/4/09 spectra-0_18.  Tagged for spectraLib only.  Added timing code and
	print operators for structures.
3/4/09 dfb-0_20.  Tagged for dfbLib only.  Added print operators.
3/4/09 channelizer-0_30.  Tagged for channelizer only.  Added print operators,
	version number.
3/4/09 daddLib-0_02.  Tagged for daddLib only.  Added timing code and
	print operators.
3/6/09 dx-1_05.  Tagged for dx only.  Major changes to CwTask to allow
	DADD detections using daddLib.  Still needs work on use of callbacks
	to do clustering and bad band reporting.  Found that bin values are
	slightly high, probably due to discard of subchannel edge bins which
	have lower average power than center bins.  ADDED A FUDGE FACTOR
	(1.06) TO BASELINE CODE IN SPECTROMETER.CPP.  WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
	HOW TO CALCULATE THE FACTOR FROM THE FILTER.
3/7/09 dadd-0_03.  Tagged for daddLib only.  Added report base classes
	to allow callers to do their own hit and bad band reporting.
3/7/09 daddLib-0_04.  Tagged for daddLib only.  ReportHit and ReportBadBand
	put in namespace dadd.  Eliminated multiple polarizations, so
	DaddBand array is no longer an array of pointers.  This means that
	all reporting for a pol should be done before starting the next
	pol.
3/7/09 dx-1_06.  Tagged for dx only.  More changes to CwTask to modify
	report and bad band handling.  Also some changes to PulseTask.  Both
	appear to be more or less working, but need lots more testing.
	Confirmation tasks are next.
3/10/09 dx-1_07.  Tagged for dx only.  Added ArchiveChannel to lib;
	creates a larger channel from multiple adjacent subchannels, taking
	into account the overlap that went into making the subchannels.  Done
	as part of work on confirmation.  [Will need to specify the stride
	between subchannels, if they are not contiguous in memory.]  Added
	test subdirectory and code to test ArchiveChannel.
3/13/09 dx-1_08.  Tagged for dx only.  Continued working on ArchiveChannel,
	adding dedrift, cleaning up test program and adding additional
	tests.
3/13/09 dx-1_09.  Tagged for dx only.  Added runtime arguments to test,
	fixed a problem in ArchiveChannel.
3/20/09 dfb-0_21.  Tagged for dfbLib only.  Made -O3 the optimization
	level.  Cleaned up wola in polyphase.cpp.  Added computeFilterFft
	in test.
3/20/09 channelizer-0_31.  Tagged for channelizer only.  Made -O3 the
	optimization level.
3/20/09 daddLib-0_05.  Tagged for daddLib only.  Made -O3 the optimization
	level.
5/23/09 sonata-0_04.  Cleanup for eventual open-sourcing.  Implemented a
	top-down build using ./reconfig followed by configure.  Added
	--enable-debug flag to configure to use debug flags (-g -O0) instead
	of release compiler flags (-O3).  Each sub-package (ATApackets,
	daddLib, etc) can be configured separately for release or debug.  From
	sonata-pkg:
		make distclean
		./reconfig
		./configure [--enable-debug]
		make leastsquares
		make
	Also revised directory structure for ATApackets and packetgen to more
	closely align with standard directory structure.
5/24/09 sonata-0_05.  Partial corrections made to compile without warnings
	with -Wall.  Mostly consisted of cleanup of class initialization order
	and casting of signed or unsigned iteration variables.  Still need to
	deal with warnings caused by "if (err = test())"; can be handled with
	an addition set of parentheses "if ((err = test()))" but this is a
	little silly.  Channelizer and front end of dx appear to be working.
	Also tested with all software (sse, packetgen, channelizer, dx) running
	on a single machine, and it appears to be okay.
6/2/09 gauss-0_02.  Initial tagged version of gaussian noise generator library.
6/2/09 gauss-0_03.  New interface for gaussLib, simplifying user signal
	interface.
6/2/09 gauss-0_04.  Moved definitions of BasicSig, CwSig, PulseSig to
	Signals.h, removed unused code and variables, added documentation.
6/2/09 gauss-0_05.  Tagged for gaussLib only.  Changed float32_t variables
	to float64_t.
6/2/09 gauss-0_06.  Tagged for gaussLib only.  Added functions to return
	version and I/F version; added version prints to test.
6/2/09 sonata-0_06.  Tagged for all of sonata-pkg.  Added gaussLib noise
	generation library, modified packetgen to use it.  dx/test must still
	be modified to use it.  "Samples" must be removed from sonataLib.
6/4/09 gauss-0_07.  Tagged for gaussLib only.  Corrected generation of
	signals and changed interface.
6/4/09 sonata-0_07.  Tagged for all of sonata-pkg.  Corrected gaussLib signal
	generation, made changes to dx/ArchiveChannel to make it consistent with
	gaussLib.  Made changes to dx/test dedrift testing code.
6/10/09 sonataLib-0_09.  Tagged for sonataLib only.  Added microfloat
	archive format (SmallTypes).
6/29/09 sonata-0_08.  Tagged for all of sonata-pkg.  Removed autogen.sh;
	use manual reconfig instead.  Added include directory just below
	sonata-pkg; put cycle.h in it and modified Makefile.am's as
	necessary.  Installation currently to sonata-pkg/sigproc_install; made
	sure that no headers are installed.  Added header files to sources
	for dx/src.  Tested "make dist", looks like it works.
6/30/09 sonata-0_09.  Tagged for all of sonata-pkg.  Checked in all
	changes to Makefile.am's.
6/30/09 sonata-0_10.  Tagged for all of sonata-pkg.  Fixed include
	directories to find cycle.h.
7/2/09 sonata-0_11.  Continued cleanup of make and configuration
	related files to enable correct execution of make and dist.
7/11/09 packetrelay-0_02.  Tagged for packetrelay only.  Added write to
	file to allow capturing of the data.

OpenSonATA (git)
10/23/09 sig-0.12.0 [master] Working version of DX which performs all
	confirmation (CW and pulse, coherent, followup and secondary).  Also
	handles start time synchronization for both channelizer and DX.
	Archive channel is not correct: the response is not flat across the
	channel.  I think the problem is understood and corrected in the
	next version.
10/24/09 sig-0.12.1 [devel] Corrected but hacked version of archive
	channel, one which (I believe) produces the correct archive channel
	with flat response across the channel.  The next version will
	make major modifications to the code to eliminate the now-irrelevant
	removal of oversampling, since the archive channel is now maintained
	in oversampled form.
10/26/09 sigdevel-0.12.2 [devel] Cleaned up the archive channel code for
	the simplified, oversampled archive channel.  This version allows
	baseline half frames to be zero.  Eliminated many compiler warning
	messages.
