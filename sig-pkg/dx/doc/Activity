			PDM Activity Class

3/6/01 kes

1.	Each activity has a set of parameters which are unique
	to it; these must be attached to the activity itself.
2.	Many of the data items are very small, and are an inherent
	part of the activity: center frequency, start time,
	data collection time, etc.
3.	Others are less closely linked, and may be associated with
	several observations.  Some of these are session parameters.
4.	Others are data produced by the system itself and may
	be very large, such as RFI and birdie masks.
5.	For the latter data types, it makes more sense to attach
	a pointer to the data.  In addition, more than one version
	of the data may be active in the system at a time.
6.	If we create a class for each of these types
	(PdmPermanentRFI, PdmBirdies, PdmRecentRFI) we can allocate
	them when the SSE sends the data, and attach a use count,
	which is initially set to 1.  When an activity is defined
	while the mask is active, the data is attached (via a
	pointer) to the activity, and the use count is incremented.
7.	When a subsequent mask is defined or the activity is resolved
	(either completed or stopped), the use count is decremented.
	If it then becomes zero, the mask wil be deleted.
