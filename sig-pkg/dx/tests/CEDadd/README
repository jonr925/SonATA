This code is Rick Stauduhar's general cache-efficient (aka divide-and-
conquer) DADD.  Unlike the original cache-efficient DADD code, it
supports non-power-of-two spectra.

As of 1/15/04, the basic code has been ported to the PDM in PdmDadd.cpp,
but has not been tested and is disabled; the relevant functions
are generalCacheEfficientDadd, generalCacheProcess, and getRowIndex.
