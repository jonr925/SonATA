/* When the DADD algorithm is run in its own memory space, the results appear 
   not in their natural order.  In the case of power of 2 DADD, the row containing 
   sums of drift k appears in row bitreverse(k). When the number of rows is
   not a power of two, the correspondence is more complicated.  "getposition"
    returns the index of the row containing pathsums with total drift
    = driftrate, in a block of size blocksize. This generalizes the 
    bit reversal calculation in a power of 2 dadd computation.

     else                  //drift is even   
	 return getposition(driftrate/2,bov2);

/* WHY THE ABOVE CALCULATION WORKS:  By induction, one can see that in 
   an m row block, the drift 0 row is always the bottom row, and the
   drift m-1 row is always the top row.  Because of the way subblocks 
   are combined, even drifts will lie in the lower subblock, and odd 
   drifts will lie in the upper subblock, with the possible exception of
   the maximum drift row, which lies at the top of the upper subblock 
   independent of the parity of its index.
   Thus, if driftrate is even, the row in question will be placed in the lower
   subblock, in the position previously occupied by the row of
   drift = driftrate/2 in that subblock, and if driftrate is odd, then the row 
   in question will lie in the upper subblock in the position previously 
   occupied by the row of driftrate = drift/2 in that subblock.
