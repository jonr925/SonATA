This version of tclreadline (originally rev 2.1.0)
has been modified to disable signal handling in the
underlying GNU readline, to avoid conflicts with signal
handling done elsewhere.

This is done by setting the GNU readline rl_catch_signals
global variable to zero:

-------------------------------
tclreadline.c:
Tclreadline_Init()
{
...

    /* T. Kilsdonk  27 Feb 2002.  
       Turn off readline signal handlers.
    */
    rl_catch_signals = 0;

}

-------------------------------

The version number was also changed to 9.9.0 so that it could
be easily distinguished from other versions.

This can be handled in two ways:

1.  If you reconfigure the automake/autoconf, etc files
before building, then the MAJOR & MINOR version number set in configure.in
should get propagated automatically.

To reconfigure:
   ./reconfig

2. If you're going to use the existing autoconf, etc files,
then this change has to be made in these 2 files:

configure:

  MAJOR=9
  MINOR=9
  PATCHLEVEL=0

config.h:
  #define VERSION "9.9.0"


--------------------------

Finally, an additional tclreadline::LoopOneLine routine
was added to tclreadlineSetup.tcl.  This is a variation
on the ::Loop routine that does not allow multiline input
(ie, no secondary input prompts), as a way to prevent
users from getting trapped in a tcl input mode.

--------------------------

Build notes & possible problems:

0. If you have any kind of automake or autoconf related problems, run

   ./reconfig

to reconstruct all the appropriate files.

1. If you get this error during configuration, you'll need to do what it says:

  checking where to look for tcl.h... configure: error:
  Can't find tcl.h.  Use --with-tcl-includes to specify the directory
  containing tcl.h on your system.

e.g.,

./configure --prefix=/home/kilsdonk/tmp/tclreadline/test-install --with-tcl-includes=/usr/local/include


2. If you get this error when tclreadline is loaded into tcl:

   "tcl load error: tputs symbol unresolved"

you'll need to hand edit config.cache to set tputs to 'no' for libcurses 
like so and rebuild:

   ac_cv_lib_ncurses_tputs=${ac_cv_lib_ncurses_tputs='no'}


3. On the Prelude sun machines, building against ncurses results in 
this link error:

  ld: fatal: relocations remain against allocatable but non-writable sections

so ncurses was removed from the terminal library search list in
configure.in.
