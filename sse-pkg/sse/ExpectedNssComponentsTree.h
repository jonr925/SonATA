/* 

Config file format:

The first line of the config file must be a standard header 
that describes the configuration file type and version. 
The header must contain the following text:

  sonata expected components vX.X

This header is followed by component entries, one per line,
which must follow one of these patterns:

  Site <site name> IfcList <ifc name> [... <ifc name>]
  Ifc <ifc name> BeamList <beam name> [... <beam name>]
  Beam <beam name> DxList <dx name> [... <dx name>]
  BeamToAtaBeams <beam name> <ataBeamName> [... <ataBeamName>]

For the Site, Ifc, and Beam patterns,
each line consists of these parts:

  The first field is the component type, which must be
  one of: "Site", "Ifc", or "Beam", 

  The second field is the component name.

  The third field is the "child component list type".  It must be
  one of "IfcList", "BeamList", or "DxList".  It must
  also be the appropriate type for its parent, as shown above.

  Any remaining fields on the line are the names of the children of this component.
  There must be at least one.   Its expected that each child component name 
  will have a subsequent entry of its own, listing its own children.
  (The exception is Dxs, which have no separate entries).  In this way the
  connections between the components (i.e., the data paths) are indicated.

  For BeamToAtaBeams, the line lists the ata beams associated with the
  given (Prelude) beam.

Comments start with #, which may appear anywhere in the line.
All text after the # is ignored.

Comments and blank lines may appear anywhere in the file except
the first line.
