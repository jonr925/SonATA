Made minor changes for compatibility with gcc4.1.1, mostly eliminating
class:: prefixes on method declarations, and adding virtual
destructors where needed.

* 2006-07-03

Tagged sse-1_13.

- Completed conversion to baseband IF.  Eliminated all code made
  obsolete by this conversion.
- GPIB device control: use commanded values when asked for status instead
  of interrogating the devices, to avoid GPIB bus collisions across
  processes
- Added a 'quiet' command to the tsig interface that makes the 
  test signal generators as radio quiet as possible, i.e., 
  turn output off; set freq to device minimum;
  set drift to zero hz/s; set output amplitude to device minimum.
- tsig pulse devices can now be specified in the config file
  as 'at33250', 'at4400', or 'internal' (ie, internal to the tone generator)
- added convertGalGridToTargetCat program
- added createHourAngleTable program: more closely matches ATA horizon model
      (adjusts for atmospheric refraction; finer grained interpolation)
- updated doppler/current.tls file for leap second on December 31, 2005
- updated mars.xyz & voyager1.xyz position files
- ata tscope interface changed to new format, for multiple beams & tunings
- scheduler changes:
    - added option that checks that all selected targets are visible,
      and that there's enough time before setting to do a full data collection
    - now attempts to restart failed activities up to a user-specified number
	of times, with a user-specified pause between each attempt
    - added mutex protection to ActivityStrategy status
    - fixed wrapup command so that it works correctly on followups
- Recent RFI mask elements can now be of variable width (i.e.,
  no longer limited to 1KHz wide).  Also, all targets that fall under
  the nominal target's FOV are excluded from the mask.  If the mask
  exceeds the maximum size allowed by the pdm, then the mask is truncated
  to that size, instead of not being sent at all, which was the former
  behavior.
- created MysqlQuery class to consolidate code for mysql access
- simplified classes in Id.cpp, eliminating unused code
- Activity: added more robust failure handling; extracted Timeout class;
   converted to use multibeam tscope interface; mutex protected actUnit lists
- Created OffPositions class, that selects OFF positions for multiple 
  synthesized beams within a primary beam FOV
- OrderedTargets:  handle primary target beam regions for multitarget
  observations (ie, galactic survey)
- ObsRange: eliminated use of new/delete to increase execution speed;
	added unit tests to cover all lines of code in Range library
- more experimental web interface work was done

* 2006-01-20

- Added support for baseband IF.
- Added more activity failure & error handling.
- Added prototype web interface using Tomcat.
- Added support for automatic system startup & shutdown, with
	access to the text interface using sockets.
- Scheduler changes:
  - tries to recover from activity failures (for a user-specified
	 maximum number of times), sends email if it can't
  - stop now correctly handles any pending followups
  - added a 'repeat strategy N times' option
  - many changes to support multibeam observing
- Added controlcomponents script that is used to control startup & shutdown
	of individual SSE components (pdms, etc), including automatic
	restart on component failure.
- Added FileSender and FileReceiver java programs that perform automatic 
	forwarding of baseline and complex amplitude (waterfall) data for
	 remote monitoring.
- PdmArchiver: error handling added for case where pdm hangs, then reconnects
- Added slalib (for galactic coordinate conversion)
- Added gseToRaDec coordinate conversion program (for finding the ACE 
	spacecraft position)
- Added new observation operation: FORCE_ARCHIVING_AROUND_CENTER_TUNING,
	 that sends fake secondary candidates to the pdm to force it to
	 archive additional data
- Added watchdog timers for 'data collection complete' and 'done sending 
	cw coherent detection (ie, primary phase of signal detection 
	finished)' activity steps
- changed precision in signal reports from Hz to milliHz
- misc refactorings to eliminate duplicate code

* 2005-02-24

Fixed a seeker bug that was sending an incorrect archiver port
number to the pdms, causing them to fail to connect to the archiver.

* 2005-02-11

Added a new environment variable, SSE_INITRC, which can be used to
override the default seeker startup file (i.e., ~/.sserc).

* 2005-02-01

- Removed obsolete RfBirdieList class, which has been superceded
by the pdm receiver birdie mask.  
- Recent RFI masks are once again being created, and are 
now compatible with multitarget mode.
- Created "multitarget" and "multitargetfollowup" activity types
so that the desired followup type will be run in multitarget
mode.

* 2005-01-26.

Tagged sse-1_11.

Pick up latest changes, including:
- scheduler can now reobserve completed targets, as needed.

Many more changes to support multi-beam observations,
including the selection of multiple simultaneous targets.

* 2004-11-30

Removed remaining references to 'main' and 'remote' from
the seeker program and seeker.schema.  Merged the "OneSite"
activity and activityUnit code into their respective parent
classes.

* 2004-11-17

Many changes to support multibeam (multitarget) observing:

- Added star (target) parameters to the seeker ActParameters
for six beams.

- beam-to-telescope associations are now specified in the
expectedNssComponents.cfg config file.

- seeker activity looks up the target star associated with each 
telescope/beam and uses that to point the telescope.

Misc changes:

- Added a check in the seeker that generates an error if the
database timezone is not UTC, since the seeker activities assume
that timestamps and date/time strings are equivalent, and in UTC.

- Reworked the activity startup error handling so that it
uses exceptions rather than boolean function status values.

* 2004-11-09

Split up & reconfigured seeker.data file:
- old AO star catalog moved to its own file
- site and spacecraft info moved to seeker.site-spacecraft.data

* 2004-09-27

tagged sse-1_08

tag multibeam changes

* 2004-09-27

Changes made to support multibeam (secondary) processing:

General:
- sse forwards secondary candidates to the pdms,
and classifies the original candidates based on the 
secondary candidate results
- archive requests wait until all secondary
candidate results are evaluated

ssePdmInterface changed:
- removed PdmMode field
- removed references to 'MAIN' and 'REMOTE' from signal
class reasons
- used the term 'secondary' for signal class reasons,
thresholds, etc. where required
- added receiver birdie mask 
- added rcvrSkyFreq to PdmActivityParameters
- removed DopplerParameters

database schema changed:
- enums changed to text fields to avoid duplicated code
(daddResolution, pol, sigClass, reason, res)
- signal class reason field now uses 'brief'
strings rather than the full-length ones
- added containsBadBands field
- removed pdm mode field 

Misc:
- sse sends a receiver birdie mask to the pdm instead of
merging the receiver birdies into the recent RFI mask

* 2004-09-27

tagged sse-1_07
(prior to sse-pdm-interface change)

* 2004-07-30

Changed telescope interface from radians to degrees/hours.

* 2004-07-28

tagged sse-1_06

ssePdmInterface changed:

  to bad band reports (ie, max allowed by limit settings)
- Added multibeam Cw & Pulse train threshold parameters.

* 2004-07-19

tagged sse-1_05

at33250 signal generator.

* 2004-06-16

tagged sse-1_03.

* 2004-06-02

Added control of third IF chain (ifc3).

* 2004-05-14

tagged sse-1_02.

The seeker, ifc, and testsig program swig wrapper files have been
modified so that they now build with swig1.3.21 (upgraded from swig1.1).  
Note that the swig generator has changed the way that it wraps global 
C++ objects: they now are treated as regular tcl variables and must
be dereferenced before they can be used.  For instance, in the seeker, 
the command 'act show' would have to be specified as "$act show".  
In order to hide this dereference, small tcl wrapper procedures have
been added to the sse-pkg/util/seekerlib.tcl file for each of the
objects in the seeker UI.  As a consequence, users must now source the
seekerlib.tcl file before the seeker can be used (normally this
is done in the user's ~/.sserc startup file).

* 2004-05-13

tagged sse-1_01.  Made template & namespace tweaks for compatibility
with gcc3.4.0.

* 2004-05-10

tagged sse-1_00.

Changed top level automake & autoconf related files (including
reconfig) to match more recent versions of those build tools.
On Solaris we're currently building against libtool 1.5.6,
automake 1.8.4, and autoconf 2.59.

Moved references to the various libraries (eg, SSEUTIL_DIR)
from the subdirectory Makefiles up into the top level configure.in file
to avoid duplication.

The --with-stlport configuration option is operational once again,
and is known to build correctly with STLport-4.6.2.

The multiple classes for the Scheduler and Strategy were condensed into
two classes, Scheduler and ActivityStrategy. The Scheduler is no longer
a separate thread; the ActivityStrategy is a separate thread. A status
member, strategyComplete_, was added to the ActivityStrategy so that
the Scheduler can delete the completed strategy objects.

Turned Followup class into a Singleton and removed its subclasses to
simplify the implementation.

The GPIBInterfaceLib/Scu.h interface was simplified and consolidated.

Approximate antenna information for the ATA was added to the database
schema and the seeker.

The sse-pkg/ifc code was cleaned up and refactored, as was the
sse-pkg/tsig code.

A MysqlResultSet class was added that automatically frees the
result set regardless of whether an error occurs.

Added another parameter to the scheduler called
'followupmode', which takes values of 'auto' & 'user'.
The scheduler uses this to decide whether to do automated 
followups when running in 'pdmtune = user' mode,
ie, for doing automated on/off & grid sequences which
the user initiates. 

Activity Ids are no longer skipped when changing stars.

TunePdms now processes pdm frequency assignments correctly around
bandwidths removed by the permanent rfi mask.

Added grid activities that do North, South, etc grid pointings,
and a 'grid' user command that initiates them.

Added 'archive disk full' error & warning limits.  The scheduler
stops if the error limit is exceeded.

Added beamsize & primaryfov to tscope params; removed unused params;
changed default tscope to ATA; changed default tune freq to 1420Mhz

Added AtaControlSim program, mostly written by Gerry Harp.

In the WaterfallDisplay program, took out incorrect division by 2 in
normalization to get proper noise level.

Misc refactorings:
- class renamings to match naming conventions.
- separating interface from implementation.

Added error handling for file open failure of baseline & compamp data files

Added bandwidth of smallest pdm as a separate argument to ChooseTarget;
removed defined constant

ssecommutil/ComponentProxy.cpp:fixed null termination bug (off end of array);
moved send & receive methods to TclProxy; used TclProxyInternal struct to
hide implementation details; put receive buffer on heap rather than stack

sse-pkg/lib subdirectory was eliminated.


* 2004-04-01

Rewrote telescope parsing & control code to match ATA control interface.

* 2004-03-23

* 2004-02-04

tagged sse-0_60.

Version in preparation for Spring 2004 observing run in
Arecibo.  Changes included:

- The seeker now has signal handling disabled.  It's hoped that this has been
the source of the occasional seeker lockups we've been seeing.
- Replacement for strcmp in ifc, tsig programs.
- New earth & mars ephemeris files.
- Candidate lookup prior to start time calculation for followups to avoid
missed start time.
- Easier manual followups (automated pdm tuning from previous activity).
- Finer-grained use of mutexs in PdmArchiverProxy.cpp to prevent deadlocks.
- Better message handling in the TclProxys (partial messages are no
longer ignored).
- New sse-watcher script, which uses the 'screen' program to monitor
the seeker.

Added new UI parameters for controlling activity timeouts:
act sigdetwait - signal detection watchdog timer wait factor
act readytimeout - component ready watchdog timeout period

Added new watchdog timers for 'pdmTuned' and 'activityComplete'
messages from pdms, that allow the activity to continue
working even if some of the pdms fail.

* tagged sse-0_48.  2003-09-02

"Field test chassis" control code added.  Pulse gen is
used to modulate AT4400 Test LO ext2 port to create 
test pulses.

* 2003-08-12
Removed shared library versions of libfree and libsse to
reduce link/runtime dependencies.

* tagged sse-0_47.  2003-07-30.

Changed the stored activity Id file format from memory-mapped
to ASCII.

* tagged sse-0_46.  2003-07-29.

2003-07-28.  Reworked rfc, ifc, and tsig programs so that they
now use static rather than shared libraries for GPIB 
device control code.  This solves several problems:
- Core dumps will no longer occur when exceptions are
thrown in the GPIB libraries when using gcc3.3 (bugzilla bug#40).
- The SSE_INSTALL env variable is no longer needed.
- There is no longer a need to put /usr/local/NI_GPIB_ENET
on your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

* tagged sse-0_45.  2003-07-15.

Pick up latest changes.

* tagged sse-0_44.  2003-07-10.

Pick up latest 2-if chain changes.

* tagged sse-0_43.  2003-07-08.

allow pulse detection to be enabled via UI parameter.

* tagged sse-0_42.  2003-06-27.

* Began adding support to control 2 independent IF chains.

* It turns out it is sometimes necessary to link against the -lz (zlib) 
compression library, depending on how the mysql library was built.  It also
appears that we can avoid the 'core dump on exception' problem on
solaris if we link against zlib version 1.1.4 rather than zlib 1.1.3. 
I've therefore restored the '-lz' option in sse/Makefile.am
and database/Reports/Makefile.am.

* The seeker, when built with gcc3.3 and ace5.3 on solaris, often
core dumps with a 'pure virtual method called' error, immediately
after an activity completes.  The problem appears to be due to a race
condition that occurs when the SchedulerStrategyImpl object is
deleted.  I've experimented with disabling the delete, and it seems to
temporarily fix the problem (at the cost of a memory leak).  I've
checked in this change for short term use until a more permanent fix
is found.

* tagged sse-0_41.  2003-06-02.
Pick up all the gcc3.3 compatibility changes.

* Changes were made throughout the package for compatibility
with gcc 3.3.  All modifications should be backwardly
compatible with gcc 2.95.  However, building the full sse-pkg
against gcc3.3 does require ACE library version 5.3 (or later).

Highlights of the changes:

- Const value initializations in class definitions were changed to
use "=" rather than "()".

- Text following #endif macros was changed to a comment.

- The keyword 'class' was added to friend declarations as needed.

- The ACE_ROOT definition was taken out of the subdirectory Makefile.am files
and instead defined in the toplevel configure.in file.

- 'typedef typename' definitions were added as needed to
avoid 'implicit typename' warnings.

- The seekerTclLib.h file was removed from sse-pkg/sse, due
to multiline strings no longer being supported.  Instead, the
seeker tcl routines defined there (and which were thereby automatically
built into the seeker's tcl interpreter) were moved to util/seekerlib.tcl
to make them available for use in a user's .sserc seeker startup file.

- To prevent the pdmsim, pdmarchiver, and tscope programs from segfaulting
when they exit, the ACE event handlers are now created on the heap
rather than the stack.  (This is an issue regarding the lifespan of event 
handlers registered with the ACE reactor, when the latter shuts down).

- _ANSI_C_ was defined in the GPIBInterfaceLib/GPIBDevice.h file so that the
appropriate prototypes in the ugpib.h where used.

- -lstdc++ was added to GPIBInterfaceLib/Makefile.am.  This was required
in order to prevent runtime "symbol not found" errors in the various
tcl interpreters.

- Linking against the -lz library resulted in a core dump in the seeker
when exceptions were thrown (at least on Solaris).  The cause is not
immediately apparent.  The -lz references were removed from the Makefile.am
files since they are (apparently) not needed.


* tagged sse-0_40.  2003-05-22
Obsolete TSS data products are no longer generated.
This tag includes all checked in code.

* Followup activities do not tune extra PDMs

* stopstrategy command added
There is a new command stopstrategy which allows current activities to
complete, but stops the current strategy, so that no further
activities are started.

* tagged sse-0_39.  Includes all code checked in by 2003-04-26,
which was used in the last night of observing at Arecibo for the 
Spring 2003 run.  Actual tag date was 2003-05-01.

* database updated
Activities.validObservation defaults to "No".  validObservations has
been added to ActivityUnits, with default of "No".  mainStxStatus and
remoteStxStatus have been added to Activities table.


* Pdms are sorted for two site observing
PDMs are sorted so that PDMs containing DADDs are first, forcing DADD
main PDMs to be paired with DADD remote PDMs, if both exist.  PDMs are
sorted alphabetically, and in predictable order.

* scheduler does not move to new star until current star's observations are complete.

* scheduler should not switch star when current star can be observed

* tagged sse-0_38. 2003-04-02. Pick up latest code changes.
Note however: the latest available ssePdmInterface.h & sseInterface.h file
changes are *not* included, since they were modified unexpectedly,
and will cause an incompatibility with the latest available pdm release.

* tagged sse-0_37. 2003-03-18.  Final lab test version before shipping
equipment to the field.

* tagged sse-0_36. 2003-03-15.

* almost complete avoid RFI mask
The autoscheduler now observes none of the RFI mask, except for a
small overlap at the lower end of an observation, slightly more than
0.1 MHz.

* tagged sse-0_35. 2003-03-12. pick up all changes since last release.

* database schema changed.

* reconfig command line arguments passed to configure

* configure.in: configure now allows "--without-stlport" option.

* tagged sse-0_34. 2003-01-30.  Set up sse-pkg for thread-safe compilations.
Added -pthreads (solaris) and -pthread (linux) gcc flag to configure.in.
Made the package compatible with the thread-safe stlport library, which 
mostly involved adding references to the std namespace.

* Add TssMask, which allows automatic scheduling to avoid observing stars which were completed with the TSS.

* tagged sse-0_33. 2002-12-06. preserve current sse version prior to update.

* tagged sse-0_32. 2002-12-05. preserve current sse version prior to update.

host is sent to the remote pdms.

* tagged sse-0_27. 2002-10-22

* seeker.schema change.
Duplicate columns deleted.  setistarnum changed to starid in starcat.
