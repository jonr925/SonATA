This is the base directory for the sonata web server files,
to be run under the jakarta tomcat web server.

INATALLING TOMCAT

mkdir ~/tomcat
cd ~/tomcat
wget http://mirror.nyi.net/apache//tomcat/tomcat-5/v5.5.31/bin/apache-tomcat-5.5.31.tar.gz
gunzip apache-tomcat-5.5.31.tar.gz
tar -xvf apache-tomcat-5.5.31.tar

This is how it was installed on sse100:

1) Put the tomcat release into /usr/local/jakarta-tomcat.
2) made new directory /home/sonata/java
3) put jdk-1_5_0_22-linux-amd64.bin in /home/sonata/java and executed it.
4) In .cshrc ${HOME}/OpenSonATA/scripts is added to the path.
4) In .cshrc  add this at end:
# For tomcat
setenv CATALINA_HOME /usr/local/jakarta-tomcat
setenv CATALINA_BASE /home/sonata/OpenSonATA/sse-pkg/web/sse-tomcat
setenv CATALINA_OPTS -Djava.awt.headless=true
setenv JAVA_OPTS "-Xms128m -Xmx128m -Djava.awt.headless=true"
setenv DISPLAY localhost:1.0
5) In /etc/init.d create new file "xvfb". It should contin this command:
   /usr/bin/Xvfb :1 -screen 0 1024x768x16 &
6) In /etc/init.d/rc3.d "ln -s ../xvfb S99xvfb"

To build:

CREATE servlets-ssi.jar

Make sure to rename the tomcat server/lib/servlets-ssi.renametojar
file to servlets-ssi.jar.

BUILD AND INSTALL
cd webapps/sonata/WEB-INF/src
make install

TO START
$CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh

TO STOP
$CATALINA_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh

By default, the web server runs on port 8080,
so to access it with your browser the URL should
look something like:

  http://localhost:8080
