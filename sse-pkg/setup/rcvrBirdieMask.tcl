# ATA/NSS Receiver birdies
# Each mask entry is a relative offset in MHz from the
# receiver RF sky freq.
# All values are in MHz.

# Scanned both beamformers on 26 Nov 2008.
# Bandwidth was 30 MHz, covering +4 to +34Mhz relative to baseband left edge.
# (RF tune offset of -19 Mhz, dx center to baseband center offset +6 Mhz)
# Looked at only ant 1g.
# No significant birdies were found.

# Subsequent RFI scans showed a few extra low power birdies, which were added.
# Note: this seems to be very dependent on which ants are in use

# Format:
# set bandcovered { <centerfreqMhz> <widthMhz> }
# set masks {
# <freq1Mhz> <width1Mhz>
# <freq2Mhz> <width2Mhz>
# ...
# }
