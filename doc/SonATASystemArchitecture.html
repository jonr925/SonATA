SonATA System Architecture Description</h3></center>

<u><h3>Overview:</h3></u>
<p>The SonATA software is primarily written in C++, with some
java and tcl. There are two main sections of the code: 
<li> SSE (Search System Executive) is the Control System.
<li> Signal Processing code which includes the Channelizer
and the DX detector.
<p>

<b>SSE/Control System:</b>
<p>There are three C++ executables in the Control System.
<li> Seeker : contains the User Interface and Scheduler as
well as the actual observation control. The various Seeker classes
maintain the observation and signal histories in a Mysql database. 
<li> Archiver : writes the science data from the DXs to the archive. 
<li> Tscope : Telescope and Beamformer Interface.

<p>
There is a Java executable for simulating the 
telescope in test mode.
<p>
And there are additional java programs to display the science data
(baselines and complex amplitudes).
<p>Internal Libraries:
<li>Doppler: Doppler corrections for target positions
<li>ssecommutil: Interprocess communication routines
<li>sseInterfaceLib: 
<li>sseTscopeInterfaceLib
<li>sseDxArchiverLib
<li>sseDxInterfaceLib
<li>sseutil
<li>util
<p>External Libraries:
<li>aaplusLib: Astronomy routines for coordinate conversion.
<li>novasLib: Astronomy routines for coordinate conversion.
<li>wcsLib: Astronomy routines for coordinate conversion.

<p>
<b>Signal Processing:</b>
<p>There are two C++ executables
<li> Channelizer
<li> DX
<p>There are three additional executables used for testing.
<li>packetgen: generates noise and signal. Writes to disk or to network(multicast).
<li>packetsend: Reads data from disk and sends to network (multicast)
<li>packetrelay: Reads Unicast packets from network and retransmits as Multicast
<p>Internal libraries
<li>dfbLib: Digital filter Bank Library
<li>sonataLib: Queue, Semaphore, Lock, message, etc. Classes
<li>spectraLib: Spectra Class
<li>ATAPackets: ATA Packet Header Classes
<li>reader: Packet receiver for testing
<p>External Libraries
<li>fftw-3.2.1
<p><b>System Configuration</b>
<p>
The SonATA system is designed to run in a multi-host environment.
The high speed data transfer is done using UDP Multicast on
10 Gb switches.
The full observing system consists of over one hundred hosts.
<li>3 for Control system 
<li>3 for Archivers
<li>12 for the Channelizers
<li>110 for the DXs
<p>
The minimum test system has 4 hosts:
<li> SSE: Seeker, Telescope Interface, telescope Simulator, Archiver, display programs
<li> SP: Channelizer
<li> SP: Multiple DXs may run on a single host
<li> SP: Beamformer Simulator/Packet Generator
