The bandwidth of the ATA receiver is 104.8576 MHz.
The SonATA channelizer filters and fourier transforms that bandwidth 
into 256 400 KHz channels.
The SonATA detector module, the DX, filters and transforms the channel
into 678 Hz subchannels and further to .678 Hz bins.

There are 2 types of SonATA data displays.
1) The baseline display shows the average power in each subchannel over
channel bandwidth. The baseline is averaged over time and is reported
every 15 or so seconds.
2) The waterfall display show the power for each bin in a subchannel.
The power values are reported every .75 seconds. The brighter the 
dot, the stronger the power.
