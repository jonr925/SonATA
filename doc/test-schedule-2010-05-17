SonATA Test Schedule
2010-05-17 jj


Tuesday, May 18 Morning and afternoon

	Single Antenna testing with both Prelude and SonATA
	1) Point at Quiet Sky and collect pulse statistics
		run concurrent obsevations
		use several pulse thresholds
		Compare raw statistics
		Pulse Stats are written to Data Base

	2) Point slightly off AMC7
		Run concurrent observations
		Compare detection results with/without hanning

	3) Point at Kepler after 3PM
		Run concurrent observations with low dadd thresholds
		Compare detection results with/without hanning
	
Thursday, May 20 2-6 PM

	Full Array Testing, Multibeams
	Compare detection results for 3 beams on Kepler
	act set multitargetnulls off
	Attempt Rosetta

Thursday, May 27 10:30-2:30 PM  (Frank's BBQ 11:30-1:30 PM)

	Full Array, Multibeam Observing

Additional Test Procedures:

	Vary the baseinitaccum from 1 to 20 to determine the minimum
		accumulation required.

	Determine average baseline power. Set appropriate limits for 
		warnings and errors.

	Check power coming out of the packetizers. 
		Compare beamformers using Channelizer Statistics.

	Correlate number of missed packets with system configuration.

	Run RFI Scans, SonATA and Prelude, Single Antenna
		1000 MHz to 9000 Mhz
		Compare detection results

 	Determine signal detection thresholds for observing
	Pulse, Triplet, CW Power, CW coherent (primary & secondary)	

	Collect statistics on Multibeam RFI rejection.
