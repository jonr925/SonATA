SonATA Data Forwarding(filesender/filereceiver)

</HEAD>
<BODY>

<pre>

The SonATA filesender/filereceiver programs can be used to forward
baseline and waterfall (complex amplitude) data from a remote system
to a local display in real-time.  This avoids the overhead of trying
to send the baseline and waterfall program graphics directly.

Example use:

Say the SonATA system is running on the remote host mozart,
and you want to forward the waterfall and baseline data for 
dxs 1005 and 1007 to a local host, fusion.


1. First log on to the receiving host (fusion in this case) as sonata
and cd into the directory used by the SonATA system to store
the baseline and waterfall files as they are collected:

  % cd sse_archive/confirmdata

2. Start the filereceiver program:

  % filereceiver

It will wait for connections from the file sender program.

3. Now log onto the host running the SonATA system (in this case, mozart),
as the sonata user, and again change to the appropriate archive directory:

  % ssh mozart -l sonata
  % cd sse_archive/confirmdata

4. Start the filesender program, specifying which files you
want to start sending.  For example, to send the baseline and
waterfall (complex amplitude) files for dx1005's left
pol, and both pols of dx1007, you would say:

  % filesender --host fusion  dx1005-L* dx1007*

5. Back on the receiving host, start the waterfall and baseline
programs as usual.  Select the desired dxs in the gui
in the usual way.  
  
   % startssedd dx1005 dx1007

If this is the first time that data for
a dx is being forwarded, you'll have to wait until some data
actually arrives before these programs will let you select
that dx.

6. Start the (remote) SonATA system.  The data should be forwarded 
automatically to the receiving host and displayed in the baseline and
waterfall programs as it's collected by the SSE.

7. When you're done, use control-C on each of the filesender and
filereceiver programs to terminate them.  

8. If the filesender loses it's connections for any reason
(error messages will appear), you can just control-C it and
rerun it.  It should re-establish connections with the
filereceiver.
