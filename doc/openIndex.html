Open SonATA: Open Source SETI on ATA</H1>

<h4> What is Open SonATA</h4>

The SonATA System is the first software-only incarnation of the SETI Institute's search system looking for narrowband radio signals of extraterrestrial origin. SonATA runs on general purpose computers, and replaces previous generations of search systems that relied on custom hardware in order to achieve the near-real time performance that is required. By implementing the SETI search system in general purpose, commodity servers, it should be possible for SonATA to benefit from future Mooreâ€™s Law growth in processing power. SonATA will be able to upgrade its searching capacity by future upgrades to its host computer cluster.  <A HREF="open-sonata-description.html">Read more</a>
