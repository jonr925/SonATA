SonATA Test Schedule
2010-05-26 jj


Wednesday, May 26, 14:00 - 17:00

	Test antenna selection.
	Run bfantselect on bf1 and bf2 for 1420, 3100, 8424 Mhz
	Run autoantselect in SonATA and compare
	Run Cal Delay on autoantselect antlist
	Check cal delay ouput for bad antennas
	Check System temperatures
	If delay aren't 0, select a list from bfantselect
	Run Cal Delay again ...

	Observe Kepler with bf1 and bf2, compare
	Use 	multi-beam-env-vars
		kepler-2beam.tcl

Additional Test Procedures:

	Vary the baseinitaccum from 1 to 20 to determine the minimum
		accumulation required.

	Determine average baseline power. Set appropriate limits for 
		warnings and errors.

	Check power coming out of the packetizers. 
		Compare beamformers using Channelizer Statistics.

	Correlate number of missed packets with system configuration.

	Run RFI Scans, SonATA and Prelude, Single Antenna
		1000 MHz to 9000 Mhz
		Compare detection results

 	Determine signal detection thresholds for observing
	Pulse, Triplet, CW Power, CW coherent (primary & secondary)	

	Collect statistics on Multibeam RFI rejection.
