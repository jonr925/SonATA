REFERENCE TABLES

Antenna:

This reference table contains the descriptions of the 
various observatories that Project Phoenix used for observing 
and/or development. It includes the longitude, latitude, altitute, 
coordinates in an earth centered coordinate system, and contact information.
This table will become Obsolete for SonATA.

AntennaLimits:

This reference table contains the limits for the field of view 
for the various telescopes. It contains the rising and setting Hour Angle 
as a function of Declination for each site. This table will become
Obsolete for SonATA.

CalTargetFlux:

This reference tables contains the catalog of calibration sources. It 
has the frequency and flux for each source.

SeekerDbVersion:

This table records the version number for the seeker.schema
source file when the database is first created.

Spacecraft:

This reference table contains transmit frequencies and name of the
ephemeris file for spacecraft.		      

TargetCat:

This reference table is the Target Catalog. It contains the 
SETI star id, catalog name if available, right ascension, declination, 
proper motion, spectral type, parallax, etc..

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTRINSICS TABLE

PdmIntrinsics:

This table records the characteristics of an individual PDM,
the host name, maximum subbands for processing, size of the 
subband, serial number, and interface Version Number.
Recorded when a pdm connects to the SSE.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PARAMETER TABLES

ActParameters:

This table saves the parameters that were set by the user for
the Activity with activity number specified by the 'id' field
These include the star id, the type of activity, the site, and time stamp,
plus various control options for error handling and archiving.

BaselineErrorLimits:

This table contains the upper and lower limits on the mean Baseline
for generating error messages.

BaselineWarningLimits:

This table contains the upper and lower limits on the mean Baseline
for generating warning messages.

PdmActivityParameters:

This table records the parameters for an individual PDM.
In addition to the parameters from PdmParameter table,
the pdm and ifc tune frequencies are included.

PdmParameters:

This table records the user parameters that apply to all PDMs,
observation length, thresholds for signal detection, limits for
error detection, and scientific data requests.

PdmScienceDataRequest:

This table records the user settings for the Science Data Request.
The sending of Baseline data, Baseline Statistics, and Complex
Amplitudes can be on or off. The baseline monitoring for warning
or error levels can be turned on or off. The Complex amplitude
data may be requested by frequency or subband number.

SchedulerParameters:

This table records the user parameters for the Scheduler which control
automatic operation of the system as well as beginning and ending sky
frequency and limitation on the target distance.

TscopeParameters:

This table records the user parameters to the Telescope.
These include the coordinate system and appropriate coordinates
(right ascension, declination J2000 or azimuth, elevation or
galactic longitude and latitude) plus the RF sky frequency and
the IF sky frequency.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACTIVITY LOGGING TABLES

Activities:

This table records the Activities' parameters in 3rd normal form
by collecting the indexes of the combinations of parameters for
each activity. In addition, it records the length, type of activity,
star id, the azimuth and elevation
of the telescope at the beginning the observation, the RF tune frequency,
IF tune frequencies, and minimum and maximum PDM tune frequencies.
The results summary combines the results for all ActivityUnits or PDMs.
The ValidObservation flag is set to 'YES' if the activity completes
normally.

ActivityUnits:

This table stores the operating parameters and detection results
for an individual Programmable Detection Module (PDM).
Besides the activity id, start time, PDM Tune frequency, 
validObservation Flag, and the
summary of signals detected and candidates, there are pointers
to other PdmActivityParameters and PdmIntrinsics tables which contains the 
user specifed parameters for all the PDMs and the description of the
individual PDM respectively. 

CandidateSignals:

This table records the signal description information for each 
Candidate. The CW incoherent power detections are recorded as 
type CwP. Each of these has the coherent algorithm applied to it
and there is a second entry for the same Candidate with type CwC.
There is only one entry for the pulse Candidates. The signal
description includes activity id, frequency, drift, width, power, 
subband number, polarization,
signal class (Candidate/RFI), and the reason for the classification.
The classification reason are described elsewhere. TBD.
The coherent CW and Pulse Candidates also have a probability of
false alarm statistic and a signal to noise ratio. The Pulse
Candidates have a pulse period and number of pulses.

CandidateCoherentSegments:

This table records the frequency, drift, power, width, probability
of false alarm, and signal to noise ratio for each Coherent
segment associated with CwC Candidate. For 98 second observations
there is only one segment, so the information is the same as in
the CandidateSignals table. For longer observations the coherent
algorithm integrates over multiple time segment because of the curvature 
of the signal caused by the doppler shift. In such cases, the signal 
description in the CandidateSignals table is a composite of all the segments.

CandidatePulseTrains:

This table records the individual pulses in a Pulse Candidate 
It includes the spectrum, bin, power, and polarization for each
pulse. There is a pointer back to the entry in the CandidateSignals
table.

DetectionStats:

This table records a detection summary from an individual PDM for an
activity. It includes the left and right raw CW paths and clusters, 
the left, right, and total pulses, total triplets as well as the
total signals and Candidates.

FollowUp:

This table records a cross-reference for correlating the 
followup activities with the original activity.

FollowUpSignals:

This table contains the confirmed Candidate signal descriptions
for followup activities. It is used for communication
between the followup activities and the original activity.

PulseTrains:

This table records the individual pulses in a Pulse Signal. 
It includes the spectrum, bin, power, and polarization for each
pulse. There is a pointer back to the entry in the MainSignals
table.

Signals:

This table records the signal description information for each 
Signal. The CW incoherent power detections are recorded as 
type CwP. The pulse Signals are recorded as type Pul. The signal
description includes activity id, frequency, drift, width, power, 
subband number, polarization, signal class (Candidate/RFI), 
and the reason for the classification.
The classification reason are described elsewhere. TBD.
The Pulse Candidates also have a probability of
false alarm statistic and a signal to noise ratio as well as
a pulse period and number of pulses.
Only the signals in the 'star' activity type are tested against
the RFI database. 

TscopeBeamStatus:

This table contains the actual pointing information for each beam for
each activity.

TscopePointReq:

This table contains the requested pointing information for each beam 
for each activity.

TscopeSubArrayStatus:

This table contains a summary of the array status for each activity,
including the total number of antennas and the number of drive errors 
for each beam, plus the feed focus and wrap.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRELUDE TABLES

ifcNStatus:

This table records the Status of the Nth IF Chain at the beginning
of an observation. These include the mean and standard deviation of
the variance for both the left and right polarizations and the
status code.

ifcNParameters:

This table records the user parameters for the Nth IF chain,
including the attenuator settings, rf sky frequency, if tune
frequency, and the input source (sky|test).

This table records the user parameters to the Test Signal Generator.

as well as the enable/disable flag.
