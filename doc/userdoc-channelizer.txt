Example:

The channelizer will receive a 3.2768 MHz input stream from packetgen
and will create 8 channels. The default input and output IP addresses
and ports are specified. The polarization is X and the center sky frequency
is 1420 MHz. Only one worker task (thread) is specified. If there are multiple
processors on your host, the worker tasks may be increased.
The Digital Filter Bank will have 10 foldings and 25 % overlap.
Statistics for the data will be printed every 10 seconds.
The real and imaginary input values will not be swapped.
