Prelude Project Description</h3></center>

Version 1.10 2010-Jan-25 20:31:51 UTC

<u><h3>Overview:</h3></u>

<p>
The Prelude System conducts observations of selected 
"Target Stars" from a star catalog or target points in a grid of 
selected positions in search of narrow-band signals of extraterrestrial origin.

&nbsp; The signals may take the form of
continuous or pulsed signals that may drift in frequency over time.
The data are processed in near real-time.

<p>
Prelude is the extension of the NSS (New Search System) to the
ATA (Allen Telescope Array)
and uses much of the same special purpose signal processing hardware 
and some of the software from the NSS,
but the search strategy is different. Whereas the NSS used
pseudo-interferometric techniques involving 2 sites to
discriminate between candidate signals and RFI (Radio Frequency
Interference), Prelude uses the multi-beam capability of the ATA.

Prelude is designed to observe with 2 or more beams looking at a 
different target with each beam. In the multitarget observing mode 
the primary candidate signals from each beam are sent to the 
Programmable Detection Modules (PDMs) on the 
other beams for verification. These secondary candidates are tested 
for coherent confirmation. If a candidate is seen in multiple beams, 
it is considered RFI. If not seen, it remains a candidate. 

Prelude is the precursor of SonATA (SETI on the ATA) in which all the
signal processing will be performed in software on general purpose computers.


<p>The ATA will produce digitized time series samples of voltage for
a 104.16 MHz bandwidth. The data for Prelude
will be converted back to analog by a custom board
and then fed into the "IF chain" (really baseband) components used in the NSS.

<p>Each PDM will process 2 MHz
of bandwidth performing a 50% overlapped in time FFT for
a 1.5 second frame. The PDM will also provide scientific data 
(baselines, complex amplitudes),
detect and report signals, and filter the signals with a recent RFI mask
to select candidate ETI signals.&nbsp; The signal detection algorithms
include Pulse Detection, and power and coherent Continuous Wave (CW)
detection. 

<p> These signals are subjected
to a series of tests to filter the RFI from the valid candidates.
The lists of candidates and signals are archived along 
with the scientific data and observational information.
If a signal survives all the filter tests, a followup procedure
is started immediately to reobserve and verify the candidacy.

<p>The Prelude System runs with a two-stage pipeline.
All the PDMs are synchronized to
start data collection at the same time.
As soon as one observation finishes data collection, another
observation may begin initialization for data collection.
The PDMs will perform signal detection for observation one while 
data is collected for observation two. Signal detection including 
coherent detection will complete
in the time of one data collection.

<u><h3> System Components </h3></u>

<b>ATA, Allen Telescope Array:</b>
<p>The Allen Telescope Array (ATA) is a joint effort by the SETI Institute 
and the Radio Astronomy Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley 
to construct a Radio Interferometer that will be dedicated to astronomical 
and simultaneous search for extra-terrestrial intelligence observations.
It is being built at the existing Hat Creek Observatory, run by the 
Radio Astronomy Lab at Berkeley, and located in the Cascades just 
north of Mt. Lassen (California).
<p>The ATA is being constructed in stages. The initial array will have
42 six-meter antennas and the final configuration will have 350.
The signals received from individual antennas are combined to form
synthesized beams for a specific pointing on the sky.
<p>The ATA will provide 4 independent RF Tunings within the range of
0.5 to 11.2 GHz. Each tuning will support 
4 independent 104.16 MHz bandwidth dual-polarization beams.

<p>There will be one primary user who controls the pointing 
of the array. 
There can be up to 3 secondary users who are given the coordinates
of the primary field of view and may select pointings within that
field of view for their observing. (Note: there could be more than
three secondary users if they can share IF tunings.)

<p>
<b>IF Chain:</b>
The digitized 104.16 MHz bandwidth data stream from the ATA is
converted back to analog by a custom board, designed and built 
in-house.  The board provides a 50 MHz bandwidth data stream 
to the NSS IF chain. 
The NSS IF Chain has been modified to accept orthogonal linear
polarizations at baseband and produce orthogonal circular polarizations.
The IF Chain redigitizes the data in a format compatible with the
PDM.
The digital IF signal will be distributed to PDMs as orthogonal
circular polarizations. 
<p>The IF Chain consists of a custom baseband Analog to 
Digital Converter
and a custom Sample Transmitter Board (STX). The output of
the STX board goes into a Fiber to Copper Board and from there
into the DDC board on the PDM.

<p><b>SSE, Search System Executive, the Control Software:</b>
<p>The Search System Executive (SSE) is the software that controls and
coordinates
the Prelude equipment.&nbsp; 
The SSE will configure, control and monitor
all hardware in Prelude and all resources needed to conduct observations
and system tests.
<p>The SSE operates on two or three Sun Blade 2000s or equivalent
under Solaris 8. The SSE Software will also operate on Linux.
&nbsp;

Prelude will be allocated one of the RF tunings, and
will use up to 3 dual-polarized beams. 

<p>
<b>PDM:</b>
<p>The hardware for the PDM units is a PC with either an STL-2
or a Xeon Motherboard running SUSE Linux with a 2.4 Kernel.
Each pdm contains 2 Bluewave Boards (Texas Instrument/Motorola
DSP Board) and 2 DDC boards (a custom 
Digital DownConverter Board). The STL-2 motherboard pdms also
contain a DADD Board (a custom board for CW power detection using the
Doubling Accumulating Drift Detection Algorithm).
There will be no upgrades or modifications to the Prelude hardware
and signal processing software
except as required to interface with ATA.

<p>Each PDM will process 2 MHz
of bandwidth performing a 50% overlapped in time FFT for
a 1.5 second frame. The PDM will also provide scientific data 
(baselines, complex amplitudes),
detect and report signals, and filter the signals with a recent RFI mask
to select candidate ETI signals.&nbsp; The signal detection algorithms
include Pulse Detection, and power and coherent Continuous Wave (CW)
detection. 

<u><h3> System Operation </h3></u>

<b>System Configuration and Resource Allocation:</b>

<p>The resources are allocated with a set of configuration files.
All these files are found in /home/nss/sse_release/setup/ directory.
The "expectedNssComponents.cfg" file lists which pdms receive input from
which IF chain and which IF Chain and pdms are on which beam.
There are also configuration files for the 3 IF Chains (ifc1.cfg, ifc2.cfg,
ifc3.cfg) and the 3 test signal generators (tsig1.cfg, tsig2.cfg, tsig3.cfg)
which specify parameters such as module name, input bandwidth, GPIB addresses,
and synthesizer device.
<p>The IF chain modules and the Test signal generator software modules
are started automatically when the Prelude System is started. The pdms
can be started automatically or by user command.
<p>
A set of default parameters including observation length, thresholds,
pulse resolutions, etc. will be selected at this time.

<p><b>System Test:</b>
<p>Each resource will be tested for proper operation,
either individually or as part of an end-to-end test suite.
<p><b>Observing Schedule:</b>
<p>A scheduler will create an observing schedule based on
resource availability, target visibility and
observing strategy. Examples of observing strategies 
include selecting targets nearest their rise time or targets that
are close to earth in light years or targets with low
declination. Typically, a database containing the observation
history will be queried for unobserved targets and frequencies.
A set of 2 or 3 targets will be
selected within the primary field of view. The same set of center 
frequencies will be assigned to pdms on each beam.
Each pdm will have the same parameters with the 
exception of the frequency and target.

<p><b>Observation Initialization:</b>
<p>The positions of the targets for the beams and 
the center frequency for the RF Tunings for the IFP
are sent to the ATA telescope control.
<br>The IF Chain is tuned. <br>Then the pdm parameters are sent.

<p><b>Slew Telescope:</b>
<p>A pointing request for the position (RA,DEC) of the 
primary field of view (if NSS is the primary user) 
along with the coordinates of each of the synthesized
beams and the RF tuning is sent to the ATA telescope interface.
The center frequency for the RF tuning is selected 
so that all the PDM frequencies fall within the RF bandwidth (104 MHz).

<p><b>Tune IF:</b>

<p>Each NSS IF Chain will be tunable to a 36 MHz bandwidth within the 104 MHz 
Local Oscillator ATA RF/IF Chain bandwidth.
1-18 PDMs will form a cluster and will receive data from the same IF
chain.
Some parts of this interface will be GPIB.
An STL-2 pc is used to interface to the STX (Sample Transmit) board.

<p> <b> PDM Initialization </b>

<p>When a PDM first connects to the SSE, it is sent
three masks to be applied during the observations. The IF Birdie
Mask represents persistent signals (1 subband bandwidth)
that are generated within the Prelude
IF Chain. The Receiver Birdie Mask represents persistent signals 
(1 subband bandwidth) that
are generated within the observatory IF Chain. The Permanent RF Mask
represents sky frequency bandwidths (usually in 2 MHz increments)
with high occupancy RFI such as
satellites, ground based radar, airplane communication, etc..
For each observation, these masks are adjusted for the current
pdm center frequency and applied to the input data stream before
signal detection is done.

<p>For each observation, the PDMs will be sent observing parameters, 
the Recent RFI mask and scientific data request for display/archive.
The recent RFI mask consists of noise and transient signals 
received within the last week that were not seen on the
current target. This mask will be applied to the detected signals.

<p><b>Data Collection:</b>
<p>The start of data collection for all PDM
is synchronized using a 1 pps time standard and 
a broadcast time of day generated by the SSE. Preceding each observation,
there is a period of baseline accumulation (default 20 half-frames)
to create the first baseline to be used for normalizing the data.
Baselines are calculated for each frame using 90% of the previous frame's
value and 10% of the current frame's value. 
<p>The PDMs will send science data for archiving and display
to the SSE.
Baselines will be archived every TBD frames for all PDMs in both
polarizations.

Complex Amplitudes will be 4 bits real and 4 bits imaginary. They
will be archived as requested.
The archive/display data will remain at the site where it was collected,
unless the network is really fast.
<br>

<p><b>Signal Detection:</b>

<p> The pdms perform a power CW detection (DADD) and pulse detection
for 1 Hz resolution.  The results from the two detectors will
be combined using a clustering algorithm that groups together signals 
that are adjacent in frequency. A CW signal description is preferred over
a pulse signal description. The resulting
Signal Descriptions will include RF frequency, drift rate,
power, RFI classification, detector type, signal width, 
detector bin width, significance, SNR, etc.  The recent RFI mask
will be applied to these signals to filter out previously seen
RFI.

All previous signals have been written to the database with 
frequency, star, drift, power,
date, etc.  The database is used as an RFI mitigation tool.
Each signal detected is compared against the most recently seen signals
in the database. If a signal is matched in the database, it is
labeled as RFI. If not, the signal becomes a candidate signal.
The candidate signals and RFI signals are reported to the 
SSE and saved in a relational database.
Only the signals seen within the last week
are used to create the "recent RFI" mask. This mask is applied
after signal detection.
Internal birdies, signals that are always present, will be
masked off before signal detection.
RFI signals that are always present, Permanent RFI,
will also be masked off before signal detection.
Recent RFI signals (within a week) will be identified after signal
detection
and reported as RFI so that the occupancy rate can be determined.
<p><b>Candidate Selection:</b>

<p>Signals which have not been seen before are reported as candidates.

<p><b>Candidate Verification: Multi-beam Mode</b>

<p>In Multi-beam mode, there are 2 or 3 pdms observing the same 
frequency range, but with different target pointings or beams. The beam
separation is a user parameter. The default value is
5 synthesized beam-widths, so that each beam can serve
as an Off-source for the other beams.
<p>The CW candidates are further processed by the coherent detection algorithm.
If the CW candidate passes the coherent probability of false alarm threshold, 
it is sent to the other pdms that are observing the same frequency 
as a secondary candidate. Pulse Candidates are also sent to the corresponding
pdms. The secondary candidates are analyzed by
searching the confirmation data (complex amplitudes) for an exact match 
in frequency and drift. A lower threshold for the coherent pfa 
(probability of false alarm) is used
for secondary detections.
<p>
When a candidate is seen in 2 or more pdms, it is classified as RFI. 
If a candidate is seen in only pdm, then it remains a Candidate and
a followup observation is scheduled.
<p><b>Followup Observations</b>
<p>First, an ON Observation is scheduled. Each pdm is initially sent
a list of the confirmed Candidates for the frequency and beam
that it is observing. The Candidates must appear within +- 100 Hz
of the predicted frequency. If the Candidates are not seen again, they 
are marked as RFI. If the Candidates are reconfirmed, they are
sent to the other pdms at the same frequency for secondary confirmation
as above. If a Candidate is seen on 2 or more pdms, it is marked
as RFI. If a Candidate is seen only on one pdm, an OFF Observation
is scheduled.
<p>For the OFF observation, each pdm is sent the list of confirmed 
Candidates for the frequency and beam that it is observing.
If the candidate is seen off-source, it is marked as RFI. If a
candidate is not seen off-source, another ON Observation is scheduled.
The OFFs do not exchange candidates for secondary processing.

<p>Alternating ON and OFF source Observations are scheduled as long
as the Candidate continues to be confirmed or until the source sets
or an observer/scientist intervenes.
During the testing phase, there is a maximum of 4 on/off followup pairs,
then normal observing resumes.

<p>The signal descriptions will be accessible from the database.
The scientific data will be accessible from the archive storage.
