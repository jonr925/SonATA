<ul>
<li> Starting one or more automated, sequential tasks.
<pre>
There are a variety of automated tasks that can be run under 
scheduler control:
<ul>
<li>autoselectants
    Automatically select ants for primary and synth beam lists
    based on ant availability and recent ant quality checks.
<li>prepants
    Prepare antennas:
     - allocate (fxconf reassign selected ants from 'none' to 'bfa')
     - turn on lnas
     - set pams
     - set feed focus for nominal band being observed
<li>freeants
    Restore ants to nominal configuration:
     - move ants to azel 225 30
     - set feed focus to 1420
     - deallocate (fxconf reassign ants from bfa to none)
<li>bfreset
    Reset beamformer ibobs (sky, walsh, rearm, dacinit)
<li>bfautoatten
    Set beamformer attemplifiers
      - point ants at dark sky (az: 330 el: 30)
      - set tunings to 1420 MHz
      - bfibob autoatten
<li>bfinit
    Initialize beamformers with selected ants
<li>bfxxx (TBD)
    Check for low ant levels (bftrackephem --calalarms...)
<li>caldelay
    Delay calibration.
<li>calphase
    Phase calibration.
<li>calphase8ghz (TBD)
    Phase calibration conducted at 8 GHz for spacecraft checks.
<li>calfreq
    Run a series of frequency calibrations.
<li>calcp (TBD)
    Circular pol calibration.
<li>obs 
    Run observing program using configured parameters.  In
    addition to SETI observing, this includes "IF" tests,
    RF tests, birdie scans, etc.  This is the default task.
<li>testsig (TBD)
    System check using baseband test signal.
<li>testgeobeacon (TBD)
    System check using a geostationary satellite beacon,
    such as amc7.  This uses a single antenna. (More TBD).
<li>testdeepspace (TBD)
    System check using a deep space probe (voyager1, etc.).
    Note: requires previous 8 GHz phase calibration.
</ul>

There are two ways to specify the list of tasks:
<ol>
<li>Set the 'tasks' scheduler parameter and issue a
'start tasks' command.  For example:

seeker>> sched set tasks caldelay,calphase,obs
seeker>> start tasks

<li>Alternately, specify the tasks as a comma separated list of 
arguments to 'start'.  This overrides the values set in 'tasks'. 
For example:

seeker>> start caldelay,calphase,obs
</ol>
<li>Example uses:
<ol>
<!-- -------------------------------------- -->
<li>Prepare antennas and beamformers, do delay and phase cals, 
and start observing.  Stop observing sometime later, and release
the ants:

seeker>> tscope connect
seeker>> sched set tasks prepants,bfreset,bfautoatten,bfinit,\
  caldelay,calphase,obs
seeker>> start tasks 
...
seeker>> stop
seeker>> freeants
seeker>> tscope disconnect

Note that 'freeants' is an alias for 'start freeants'.

Or, equivalently:
seeker>> tscope connect
seeker>> start prepants,bfreset,bfautoatten,bfinit,caldelay,\
  calphase,obs
...
seeker>> stop
seeker>> freeants
seeker>> tscope disconnect

<!-- -------------------------------------- -->
<li>Run a suite of system checks, calibrate, then observe:

seeker>> tscope connect
seeker>> start testsig,testgeobeacon,autoselectants,prepants,\
  bfreset,bfautoatten,bfinit,caldelay,calphase,calfreq,calcp,obs
...

<!-- -------------------------------------- -->
<li>Calibrate, run a spacecraft test at 8 GHz, then observe in 
another band

seeker>> sched set tasks prepants,bfreset,bfautoatten,bfinit,\
   caldelay,calphase8ghz,testdeepspace,calphase,obs
seeker>> start tasks 


<!-- -------------------------------------- -->
<li> Fully automated observing, wide freq band:

Normally you'd source a parameter file first:

seeker>> source obs-params.tcl

These parameters, among others, would be set in that file:

seeker>> sched set target auto
seeker>> act set type target
seeker>> tscope set antlistsource antgroup

seeker>> sched set tasks autoselectants,prepants,bfreset,bfautoatten,\
  bfinit,caldelay,calphase,calfreq,obs 

Connect to the telescope:

seeker>> tscope setup

Start the sequence of tasks:

seeker>> start tasks
...
seeker>> stop
seeker>> freeants
seeker>> tscope cleanup

</ol>

Notes:
<ul>
<li>If a stop command is issued, the sequence terminates at that point.
If you are using the tasks list to specify the tasks,
then saying 'start tasks' again will cause it to begin
again with the first task on the list.

<li>It's important to remember to issue the 'freeants' command to 
free up ATA resources when the observing session is complete.
'freeants' can be run directly as a standalone command, or as a scheduler
task, e.g., 'start freeants'.

<li>'tscope setup' is an alias for 'tscope connect'

<li>'tscope cleanup' is an alias for 'tscope disconnect'

<li>Some tasks that run in a fully automatic way can also be run
"semi-manually" by specifying the 'obs' task directly with appropriate
parameters.  Be careful to distinguish between the two:

For example, if you wanted to run a fully automated delay calibration,
where the system picks the target and integration time for you,
you would say:

seeker>> start caldelay

or equivalently:

seeker>> sched set tasks caldelay
seeker>> start tasks

If you wanted to specify the target (casA = ID 406) and 
integration time (30s) yourself, you would say:

seeker>> act set targetbeam1 406
... [set target on other beams]
seeker>> act set type cal
seeker>> tscope set caltype delay
seeker>> tscope set caltime 30
... [set other params as needed]

Then run an 'obs' task by doing either:

seeker>> sched set tasks obs
seeker>> start tasks

or

seeker>> start obs

This will run the calibration activity with the settings you've
provided.

</ul>

<hr>
<li><b>Selecting ants</b>:

Ants to be used can be specified in these ways:

   1. Use the tscope parameters (manual settings).  
 
        tscope set antlistsource param
        tscope set antsxpol 1a,1b
        tscope set antsypol 1b,1c
        tscope set antsprimary 1a,1b,1c,1d

   2. Use the backend server 'antgroup':

      First:
       
        tscope set antlistsource antgroup

      Then:

        Tell the backend server to automatically select ants based on
        ATA information (fxconf, arrayhealth) etc., putting them 
        into the appropriate antgroups.

        This can be initiated with the seeker 'autoselectants' strategy,
        or run manually with this tscope immediate command:

          tscope autoselectants

        TBD: At some point there should be an option that says whether 
        prelude should take all the available ants and point them as 
        part of its observing (for the benefit of commensal observers)
        or whether it should leave the ants it doesn't need on the free
        list.  Initially it will take and point all the ants.

</ul>
