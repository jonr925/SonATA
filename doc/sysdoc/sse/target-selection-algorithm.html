<h3>  Prelude Target Selection Algorithm </h3>
<pre>

The Prelude SETI scheduler takes the following factors into account
when selecting targets:
<ul>
Target "merit" factors (user parameter names are in parenthesis):

<li> Catalog type ("catalog")
<li> Declination ("dec")
<li> Distance ("dist")
<li> Position near meridian ("meridian")
<li> Remaining time until target sets ("timeleft")
<li> Fraction of frequency band observed ("completelyobs")
<li> Primary beam target ID ("primaryid")

Other factors:

<li> Target visibility
<li> Angular separation from Sun and Moon
<li> Declination separation from geostationary satellite band

For multitarget observations:

<li> Minimum angular separation between targets 
<li> Target visibility within primary beam
</ul>

I. Scheduling algorithm:

1.  Determine how the primary beam Field of View (FOV) will be
    selected, and load target catalogs as required:

    A. As primary observer:

       Load the high priority catalogs, if not already loaded.
       These will be used to choose the targets that
       will determine the center of the primary FOV.
       Cull those targets that fall outside the user-selectable 
       min/max declination limits.

    B: As commensal observer:

       Use the current ATA primary beam position as the primary FOV.
       Load all "on-demand" targets that could fall within this
       primary FOV, based on the lowest possible observing frequency.

2. Eliminate targets that:

   a. are not visible.

   b. fall within preassigned primary-beam pointing regions that
         are only partially visible (survey mode only).

   c. fall within the user-selectable Sun & Moon avoidance angles.

   d. fall within a user-selectable avoidance angle of the
      geostationary satellite band declination for the site.

3. Choose a "first" target:

   a. If the current "first" target is still available and has not
      been fully observed, then continue observing it.

   b. Otherwise, of the targets that remain, assign a score to each based 
      on the merit factors shown below.  Choose the target with the highest 
      score.  

4. Choose additional targets for multiple beams, if needed:

   a. If the current additional targets are still visible, continue to 
      observe them.  Otherwise:

   b. Determine the primary beam FOV:

      1. As primary observer: 

           If the first target has a preassigned primary beam position 
           associated with it (survey mode), then use that for the 
           primary FOV.

           Otherwise use the first target's coordinates as the center of the
           primary beam FOV.

      2. As commensal observer:

           Use predefined primary FOV.

   c. Load the "on-demand" targets from the database that roughly cover
      this primary FOV, if not already loaded.

   d. Eliminate targets that fall outside the primary beam FOV.

   e. For each additional target desired:  

      1. Eliminate targets that are closer than the minimum angular
         separation to the already chosen targets

      2. Pick the top scoring target


II. Merit Factors

The score is created by multiplying the merit factors, which are:
<ul>
<li> Catalog Type
<li> Declination
<li> Distance
<li> Position near meridian
<li> Remaining time until target sets
<li> Fraction of frequency band observed
<li> Primary beam target ID

</ul>
Merit factors in more detail:
<ul>
<li> Catalog Type:

   High priority catalogs are preferred over low priority catalogs.
   The first catalog on each list gets preference within that list.

<li>Target Declination:

   General rule: prefer lower declination targets, due to their lower
   time availability.

   Nominal value ranges (North Pole to South Pole): [1 : 71]

<li>Target Distance:

   General rule: prefer closer targets.

   If max lightyears limit (user parameter) exceeded:
      Merit = 0
   Otherwise:
      DREHER_DIST_CONST = 256;
      Merit = parallaxArcSec * parallaxArcSec * DREHER_DIST_CONST
      Nominal value ranges (1000 to 1 PC): [0.000256 : 256]

   Note: minimum value is currently forced to be no less than 1
   and max lightyears limit is ignored.

<li>Target position near meridian:

   General rule: prefer targets near the meridian, particularly
   on the rise side.

   Specific merit factors:
     Within 2 hours on the rise side of meridian:  200 to 150
     Within 1 hour on the setting side of meridian:  100 to 150
     Otherwise:  100

<li>Remaining time until target sets:

   General rule: this is a gradual gradient, so that there
   is a tendency to pick targets nearer to rising, 
   without overpowering the merit factor that favors targets
   at lower declinations.
   
   Not visible, or min time reserved for followups is not available:
      Merit = 0
   Otherwise:
      Nominal value ranges: [~1.15 : 1.0]

<li>Fraction of frequency band observed:

   General rule: prefer targets in this order:
      1. partially observed, in order to try to finish them
      2. complete unobserved
      3. fully observed 

   Merit = 1/(1 - fractionObserved)  (max=10)
   Nominal value ranges: [1.0 : 10.0]

   If target has been fully observed, the observed freqs are 
   cleared and:

      Merit = Merit * 0.001

<li> Primary beam target ID

   Targets whose primary target ID matches that of the preferred 
   primary target ID get a higher merit.

</ul>
