NSS signal classifications & reasons.
Organized by the messages sent between the PDM and SSE.

Note: In multibeam mode, the initial pdm detections
will be referred to as the "primary" ones, and the
signal searches that a pdm does for its counterparts
will be called the "secondary" signals.

TBD: add bad band reclassifications?


One Site Observing - single beam
================================

1. pdm sends candidates (cw power & pulse)

     CAND/PASSED_POWER_THRESH

     (for pulses, SSE changes to CAND/CONFIRM)

2. pdm sends signals (cw power & pulse, for archive only)

     CAND/PASSED_POWER_THRESH   (candidate repeated)
     RFI/ZERO_DRIFT
     RFI/RECENT_RFI_MATCH
     RFI/DRIFT_TOO_HIGH

     For remaining non-candidate, non-RFI signals:
     If selecting candidates, then
        UNKNOWN/TOO_MANY_CANDIDATES
     else
        UNKNOWN/PASSED_POWER_THRESH
	  (SSE may change reason to RFI_SCAN or BIRDIE_SCAN)

3. pdm sends Coherent CW signals

     CAND/PASSED_COHERENT_DETECT
        (SSE changes to CAND/CONFIRM)

     RFI/FAILED_COHERENT_DETECT



One Site Observing - multiple beams
====================================

1. pdm sends candidates (cw power & pulse)

     CAND/PASSED_POWER_THRESH 

     (SSE leaves unchanged)

2. pdm sends signals (cw power & pulse, for archive only)

     CAND/PASSED_POWER_THRESH   (candidate repeated)
     RFI/ZERO_DRIFT
     RFI/RECENT_RFI_MATCH
     RFI/DRIFT_TOO_HIGH

     For remaining non-candidate, non-RFI signals:
     If selecting candidates, then
        UNKNOWN/TOO_MANY_CANDIDATES
     else
        UNKNOWN/PASSED_POWER_THRESH
	  (SSE may change reason to RFI_SCAN
	    or BIRDIE_SCAN)

3. pdm sends Coherent CW signals

     CAND/PASSED_COHERENT_DETECT
     RFI/FAILED_COHERENT_DETECT

     (SSE leaves unchanged)

4. sse sends candidates from counterpart pdms (from step 1
  & step 3) to this pdm when all the pdms have reported in,
  for "secondary" processing:

     CAND/PASSED_POWER_THRESH (cw power & pulse)
     CAND/PASSED_COHERENT_DETECT (cw)

5. pdm sends Pulse Candidate Results and CW Coherent Candidate Results
   (for counterpart candidates from step 4)

   Note: The pdm will turn off zero drift rejection (which also affects
   'drift too high' rejection)  and recent RFI rejection for these
   signals, and so will not classify them as RFI for any of those
   reasons.

   If signal was seen, the class/reason is one of:

     CAND/PASSED_POWER_THRESH (pulse)
     CAND/PASSED_COHERENT_DETECT (cw)

     (SSE changes to CAND/SECONDARY_FOUND_SIGNAL)

   If signal was not seen:

     RFI/FAILED_POWER_THRESH (pulse) 
     RFI/FAILED_COHERENT_DETECT (cw)

     (SSE changes to UNKN/SECONDARY_NO_SIGNAL_FOUND)

6.  SSE reclassifications of original candidates:

    SSE searches the candidate results across all counterpart
    pdms for matches to the original candidates reported in 
    steps 1 & 3.

    If the SSE finds that the original candidates for this 
    pdm were not seen in any counterpart pdms; or, if seen,
    were reduced in strength consistent with nulls in those beams,
    then they are reclassified as
      CAND/CONFIRM
    else
      RFI/SEEN_MULTIPLE_BEAMS

    (Implementation note: the SSE should only store the signal once,
    and modify just the classification reason when it changes).


Candidate reconfirmation
========================

Pdm steps for reobserving confirmed candidates: 
-----------------------------------------------

1) SSE first does an ON, then an OFF

2) SSE gives the pdm a list of confirmed candidates from
   the previous observation, with predicted frequencies
   based on their drift rate and the time between observations.

3) pdm does regular CW Power & Pulse detections to generate
   new candidates, and matches them against the given
   candidates


Signal classifications:
-----------------------

ON observation - single beam:
-----------------------------
   SSE provides list of candidates for the pdm to reobserve.
   pdm results:

     CAND/PASSED_POWER_THRESH (cw)
         (SSE leaves unchanged)

     CAND/PASSED_COHERENT_DETECTION (cw)
     CAND/PASSED_POWER_THRESH (pulse)
        (SSE changes reason to RECONFIRM)

     RFI/NO_SIGNAL_FOUND
     RFI/ZERO_DRIFT
     RFI/DRIFT_TOO_HIGH
     RFI/RECENT_RFI_MATCH
     RFI/FAILED_COHERENT_DETECT (cw)
        (SSE leaves unchanged)


ON observation - multiple beams:
--------------------------------
   SSE provides list of previous candidates for the pdm to reobserve
   (only those for the target the pdm is observing).

   In detail:    

   1.  pdm sends candidates (cw power & pulse, one for each SSE candidate sent)
       Results must be one of:

       CAND/PASSED_POWER_THRESH (pulse & cw power)
       RFI/NO_SIGNAL_FOUND
       RFI/RECENT_RFI_MATCH
       RFI/ZERO_DRIFT
       RFI/DRIFT_TOO_HIGH

       (SSE leaves unchanged)

   2.  pdm sends signals (cw power & pulse, for archive only)

	   same as before

   3.  pdm sends Coherent CW signals
	
	   same as before

   4.  sse sends candidates from counterpart pdms

	   same as before

   5. pdm sends Pulse Candidate Results and CW Coherent Candidate Results

	   same as before

   6. SSE reclassifications of followup candidates:

      If SSE finds that the followup candidates for this pdm
      were not seen in counterpart beams, or if seen, were
      reduced in strength consistent with nulls in those beams, 
      then they are reclassified as
        CAND/RECONFIRM
      else
        RFI/SEEN_MULTIPLE_BEAMS


OFF observation - single beam & multibeam: 
-----------------------------------------
   SSE provides candidates (same as ON observation)

   Pdm results:

     (pulse) CAND/PASSED_POWER_THRESH 

        If nulls are in use, and the signal strength from the 
        previous ON was reduced by an amount consistent with
        the null:
           (SSE changes to CAND/RECONFIRM)  

        Otherwise:
           (SSE changes to RFI/SEEN_OFF)

     (cw) CAND/PASSED_POWER_THRESH

        Wait for coherent detection report to determine candidate
        status.

     (pulse or cw) RFI/NO_SIGNAL_FOUND
        (SSE changes to CAND/RECONFIRM)

     Note: The sse disables zero drift rejection (which also affects
     'drift too high' rejection)  and recent RFI rejection
     for these signals, and so the pdm should not classify them as 
     RFI for any of those reasons.  However, if those options were enabled, 
     the results would be one of:

        RFI/RECENT_RFI_MATCH
        RFI/ZERO_DRIFT
        RFI/DRIFT_TOO_HIGH

        (SSE leaves unchanged, i.e., it's still RFI, not a candidate) 

   Coherent CW detection reports:

      For those CW candidates that the pdm reported as
      PASSED_POWER_THRESH, when it sends the subsequent
      coherent detection reports, i.e.,

         CAND/PASSED_COHERENT_DETECTION
         or RFI/FAILED_COHERENT_DETECT

      We don't care whether it passed coherent detection or not.

      If nulls are in use, and the signal strength from the 
      previous ON was reduced by an amount consistent with
      the null:
          (SSE changes to CAND/RECONFIRM)

       Otherwise:
          (SSE changes to RFI/SEEN_OFF)

   All other signals:  (TBD: will there be any other signals?)
     UNKNOWN/PASSED_POWER_THRESH
        (SSE changes to UNKNOWN/SEEN_OFF)

     (TBD:  UNKNOWN/PASSED_COHERENT_DETECTION? )


HPBW/GRID
---------

1. Grid related signal classifications are:

     CAND/SEEN_GRID_X
     CAND/NOT_SEEN_GRID_X
     RFI/FAILED_COHERENT_DETECT_GRID_X
     RFI/ZERO_DRIFT_GRID_X
     RFI/RECENT_RFI_MATCH_GRID_X

   where X is WEST, SOUTH, GRID_ON, NORTH, and EAST.

   Example WEST signal classifications:

     CAND/PASSED_POWER_THRESH (cw)
         (SSE leaves unchanged)

     CAND/PASSED_POWER_THRESH  (pulse)
     CAND/PASSED_COHERENT_DETECTION (cw)
         (SSE changes to CAND/SEEN_GRID_WEST)

     RFI/NO_SIGNAL_FOUND
        (SSE changes to CAND/NOT_SEEN_GRID_WEST)

     RFI/FAILED_COHERENT_DETECT
        (SSE changes to RFI/FAILED_COHERENT_DETECT_GRID_WEST)

     RFI/ZERO_DRIFT
        (SSE changes to RFI/ZERO_DRIFT_GRID_WEST)

     RFI/RECENT_RFI_MATCH
        (SSE changes to RFI/RECENT_RFI_MATCH_GRID_WEST)

   There will also be a classification of

     CAND/GRID_PREDICTION

   for implementation reasons.  See details below.


2.  a)  Observation order:  WEST, SOUTH, GRID_ON, NORTH, EAST.
   Start with WEST since that's the first to set.  The order of
   the other pointings is less critical but we'll use this sequence
   by convention.

   b)  It's expected that the signal power will drop by 1/2 for
   the W,S,N,E pointings.   Use a longer observation length for the
   grid pointings (including the GRID_ON) to compensate for
   expected lower signal power.  Note that this will require
   a change in thresholds.

   c)  For the W,S,N,E pointings, always classify the results
   as candidates, even if they are not detected (e.g.,
   CANDIDATE/NOT_SEEN_GRID_WEST).  In other words, always
   continue on with the next activity type after a W,S,N,E
   pointing, whether a signal is detected or not. 

   Moreover, always use the signal detection from the previous ON
   for freq drift predictions in the subsequent grid pointings.
   I.e., do not use any of the detections in the W,S,N,E
   for predictions, since they may be less accurate, if there's
   any detection at all.  See implementation details in (3) below.

   d)  A CW signal does have to pass coherent detection 
   to still be considered a candidate that's "SEEN"
   (eg, CANDIDATE/SEEN_GRID_WEST) even on the W,S,N,E pointings.

   e) For the center GRID_ON, terminate the grid sequence if
   the candidate is not re-detected, or it's found to be zero drift
   or matches the recent RFI database.

     TBD: Open up the recent RFI mask region around the predicted
     candidates, to prevent elimination of signals that drift into
     a masked region?

     TBD: Turn off zero drift rejection, to prevent elimination of 
     signals?



3. CAND/GRID_PREDICTION classification:
   (implementation details)

   In order to implement the rule of always using the signal 
   detection from the previous ON for freq drift predictions
   in the subsequent N,S,E,W grid pointings, the SSE will
   do the following:

   At the start of an N,S,E,or W activity, the SSE will "preload" the
   candidate signals database table with the projected candidate
   information, and classify it as CAND/GRID_PREDICTION.  The
   subsequent followup activity will include this candidate type in
   the list of candidate signal types it will accept for further
   processing, and it will ignore any CAND/SEEN_GRID_X or
   CAND/NOT_SEEN_GRID_X entries.  (This is similar to the way that
   an ON activity following an OFF knows where to look for a signal
   that was not detected by the pdm in the OFF).

   Note:  It will also be necessary for the subsequent activities
   to accept CAND/SEEN_GRID_ON candidate types for further processing.


4. Grid sequence will be followed by user-decided action.
   (No automated follow-on for now).



More notes & TBD:
-----------------
1.  When SSE replaces a signal class/reason assigned by the
PDM, it should record the old reason.

2. Must be able to turn off RFI database lookup and database
update for some activity types, and under user control from the UI.

Two Site Observing
==================

Except where noted, all the classifications & reasons
below are assigned by the specified pdm.

1. send candidates (cw power & pulse)

   From main pdm only (relayed to remote):
     CAND/PASSED_MAIN_POWER_THRESH

     (note: may need a new reason for pulses, eg PASSED_SNR?)

2. send signals (cw power & pulse, for archive only)

   From main pdm:
     CAND/PASSED_MAIN_POWER_THRESH   (candidate repeated)
     RFI/ZERO_DRIFT
     RFI/MAIN_RECENT_RFI_MATCH

     For remaining non-candidate, non-RFI signals:
     If selecting candidates, then
        UNKNOWN/TOO_MANY_CANDIDATES
     else
        UNKNOWN/PASSED_MAIN_POWER_THRESH

   (Note: SSE may change the 'unknown' reasons to
   RFI_SCAN or BIRDIE_SCAN for those activity types).

   From remote pdm:
     RFI/ZERO_DRIFT
     RFI/REMOTE_RECENT_RFI_MATCH
     UNKNOWN/PASSED_REMOTE_POWER_THRESH

3. send Coherent CW signals

   From main pdm, relayed to remote pdm:
     CAND/PASSED_MAIN_COHERENT_DETECT
     RFI/FAILED_MAIN_COHERENT_DETECT

     (NOTE: The signal is still relayed to the
     remote even if it's been classified as
     RFI, so that all candidates can be accounted
     for).


4. send Pulse Candidate Results and CW Coherent Candidate Results

   From remote PDM only:

     CAND/REMOTE_CONFIRM
     RFI/FAILED_REMOTE_THRESH
     RFI/REMOTE_SNR_TOO_HIGH
     RFI/REMOTE_SNR_TOO_LOW
     RFI/REMOTE_RECENT_RFI_MATCH     (sse needs to be able to disable)

     For "CW Coherent" only add:
     RFI/FAILED_MAIN_COHERENT_DETECT (assigned by main pdm)

     [Note: REMOTE_SNR_TOO_HIGH/LOW results from the main/remote
     SNR ratio comparison.]



Two Site ON observation:
---------------
   SSE provides list of candidates to reobserve.
   Pdm matches the previous candidates against the new
   candidates.  If there's a match, proceed with normal processing.
   If not found, mark the previous candidates as RFI/NO_SIGNAL_FOUND.
   If found but rejected for zero drift or db match reasons,
   then pdm marks them as RFI/<reason>.
    

     (TBD: do anything with CAND/PASSED_MAIN_POWER_THRESH?)

     CAND/PASSED_MAIN_COHERENT_DETECTION (cw)
     CAND/PASSED_MAIN_POWER_THRESH (pulse)
        (Both cases:  SSE changes reason to MAIN_RECONFIRM)

     RFI/NO_SIGNAL_FOUND
     RFI/ZERO_DRIFT
     RFI/MAIN_RECENT_RFI_MATCH
     RFI/FAILED_MAIN_COHERENT_DETECT (cw only)
        (SSE leaves unchanged)

   Remote pdm:  (two site only)
     CAND/REMOTE_CONFIRM
        (SSE changes to CAND/REMOTE_RECONFIRM)

     RFI/<the usual reasons>   
        (SSE changes to RFI/NO_REMOTE_RECONFIRM)
