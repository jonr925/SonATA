MARS

Mars Odyssey Details
--------------------
 Mars Odyssey is in polar orbit around Mars at an altitude of
 400 km. At this height, a Martian orbital period is ~118
 minutes, speed 3.36 km/s, and the spacecraft is occulted behind
 Mars a maximum 35% of the time. The frequency is 8406.8519
 MHz. E.i.r.p. is (according to the docs) ~91 kW. Doppler shift
 has three components; gross motion of Mars (fairly static, -375
 kHz at present), diurnal shift due to Earth's motion (slow at
 +/-10 kHz), and very fast due to its motion about the Planet
 (+/-100 kHz). It needs chasing!

http://www.amsat-dl.org/p5a/reception_g3ruh.htm</a>
2003 Nov 24
 Mars Express is, at the time of writing, en-route to Mars,
 carrying the Beagle lander. Its frequency is 8420.4321 MHz,
 and e.i.r.p. is specified as ~550 kW. The carrier supports a
 variety of modulation schemes. In particular, at any particular
 time it may be OFF, or more likely phase modulated with data.
 The modulation index is controllable according to mission
 needs. It was +/-1.25 radian during our tests, which leaves a
 residual carrier of 20*log(cos(1.25)) dB or -10 dB. The
 spacecraft's speed is of order 16 km/s, which gives a nominal
 doppler shift of -450 kHz. Superimposed upon that is
 additional diurnal shift due to the Earth's rotation of order
 +/-10 kHz. The changes are very slow, and do not hinder
 tuning and spectrum analysis.

http://www.irf.se/rpg/aspera3/PDF/MEX_SpaceGround_IF_Ctrl_Doc%20.pdf</a>

S-Band 2296.482 MHz (DSN CH 18) (TBC)
X-Band 8420.432 MHz (DSN CH 18)

The telemetry modulation scheme is PCM/PSK/PM on a square wave
subcarrier for transmitted symbol rates as high as 52 ks/s. With the
baseline concatenated encoding, two subcarrier frequencies shall be
used, 8.193 kHz for the low bit rates and 262.144 kHz for the high bit
rates.

Mex only: For higher transmitted symbol rates, the telemetry
modulation scheme shall be PCM/SP-L directly on the carrier.

Mex & Rosetta:
The following operational modes shall be supported for the downlink:
unmodulated carrier, telemetry, ranging, telemetry and ranging

Mex & Rosetta:
Downlink is Right-Hand Circular pol.

The ranging signal in the ranging channel of the transponder directly
phase modulates (PM) the downlink carrier. When simultaneous ranging
and telemetry is performed, the two signals are added prior to phase
modulation of the downlink carrier.

 March 2004: ROSETTA was launched on its long
 journey into deep space, and we tried to receive signals of
 the spacecraft. On 20 March 2004 Freddy de Guchteneire,
 ON6UG has received strong data and carrier signals with
 help of the 20m dish at Bochum observatory as can be seen
 from the AO-40Rcv diagrams. Click on the diagrams to
 hear the sound of the signals. The distance to the
 spacecraft was 5.8 Million km. The screenshot shows the
 total bandwidth of the signal, see the comment by G3RUH.
 Comment by Freddy, ON6UG: The signal is so strong that
 it can be easely received with small dishes like 1 m/ and
 less. This beacon will be there for some years so it is very
 usefull for those that want to optimize their antennas on
 X-band. 

 But it can be done much more simply as Peter Griebel,
 EA8BFK (DJ9PC) on Fuerteventura, Canary Islands
 (IL38BO) has proven. Using an 1m offset dish with 5 1/2
 turns helix feed he was able to receive ROSETTA on 19
 March at 08:48 UTC on 8421.631 MHz. The distance to
 the spacecraft was then 5.515 Million km. The diagarm
 aside shows the signal quality. 

 Likewise, Charlie Suckling G3WDG used a 3m dish for
 similar results; he pointed the dish in "more or less the right
 direction", and heard it immediately. Rosetta offers a
 superb strong microwave beacon for many hours each day.
 Its maximum range will be about 77 million km at the end
 of 2004 August, returning in 2005 March for its Earth
 fly-by to pick up energy.

 James Miller, G3RUH has produced a list of position data
 of ROSETTA which you can see here. In addition he tells
 you how to obtain your own AZ/EL data. 

<a href="http://www.amsat-dl.org/p5a/g3ruh.txt">
http://www.amsat-dl.org/p5a/g3ruh.txt</a>

  Thats very interesting, as it shows a bandwidth totalling 1 MHz
  rather than the very limited few kHz of PC displays.

  It is a very useful plot because it tells us the residual carrier power as
  a proportion of the total TX power

  You can clearly see that the data is modulated onto a ~260 kHz subcarrier,
  and there is residual carrier in the middle.  The data rate appears to be
  60 kbps.  The resolution bandwidth is 3 kHz, so the total power in the
  sidebands is 2 x 60/3 = 40:1 or 16 dB compared with the sidelobe's displayed
  level.  The carrier is at +6 dB compared with the sideband peak, and therefore
  at 6 - 16 = -10 dB compared with the total sideband power.

  That is, ~91% of the power is in the sidebands, and ~9% in the residual
  carrier.

  I have also analysed an audio file from Charlie G3WDG, and was able to
  estimate the Rosetta carrier e.i.r.p.  Actually it has a 2.2m dish and the 
  TX power is 28 W max.

   From: Samuel Gulkis 

The information I received confirms your downlink frequency. Also, 
the transmitter is currently turned on continuously. This will be 
turned off when the S/C goes into hibernation at a future date ( ?? 
2011). It would be useful for you to have the S/C trajectory file so 
that you can calculate the doppler for comparison with your 
measurements. I'll see if I can get this for you - but don't expect a 
really quick turn around on this one.

On March 31st, 2006 an AMSAT-DL / IUZ team received the American space
probe VOYAGER 1 with the 20m antenna in Bochum.  The distance was 14.7
billion km.  This is a new record for AMSAT-DL and IUZ Bochum.  The
received signal was clearly identified through means of doppler shift
and position in the sky. The receive frequency was exactly measured
and compared with the information provided by NASA.

Uplink communications use an S-band link at 2115 MHz and can be received over the

the LGA or HGA, or at 8415 MHz X-band over the HGA.

http://tmo.jpl.nasa.gov/tmo/progress_report/42-131/131H.pdf</a>

Consequently, the designers of the Voyager transponder intentionally separated
the USO and VCO frequencies (at the 19-MHz level) by that amount
(a distance of four Deep Space Network (DSN) channels), leading to a relatively
large separation of 5.4 MHz at X-band between the coherent and noncoherent downlink
channels.

<a href="http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/documents/pag/INST.CAT">
http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/documents/pag/INST.CAT</a>

The spacecraft radio system was constructed around a redundant  
pair of transponders.  Each transponder was equipped with an    
S-band receiver (2115 MHz nominal frequency) and transmitters   
at both S-band (2295 MHz nominal) and X-band (8415 MHz nominal).
 
The transponder generated downlink signals in either 'coherent' 
or 'non-coherent' modes, also known as 'two-way' and 'one-way,' 
respectively.  When operating in the coherent mode, the         
transmitted carrier frequency was derived coherently from the   
received uplink carrier frequency with a 'turn-around ratio' of 
240/221 at S-band and (11/3)*240/221 at X-band.                 
                                                                
In non-coherent mode the transmitted frequency was controlled   
by an on-board oscillator; the X- and S-band remained coherent  
in the ratio 11/3.  A single Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) was  
used during radio occultations; it provided stabilities         
several orders of magnitude better than the conventional

The Stardust spacecraft is now in solar orbit, and an extended mission
has been approved: it will fly by comet Tempel 1 on February 14,
2011. Stardust will be the second visitor to Tempel 1; the first, Deep
Impact, smashed an impactor into the comet's nucleus, creating a
crater that was obscured from view to Deep Impact's cameras by dusty
ejecta. Stardust's return to Tempel 1 will provide the first cloudless

In France, F5PL first detected the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE)
spacecraft on 10 December 2003. ACE orbits the L1 libration point
which is a point of Earth-Sun gravitational equilibrium about 1.5
million km from Earth and 148.5 million km from the Sun. With a
semi-major axis of approximately 200,000 km the elliptical orbit
affords ACE a prime view of the Sun and the galactic regions
beyond. The spacecraft has enough propellant on board to maintain an
orbit at L1 until ~2019. The signal is about six dB above the
background (which includes significant sun noise) on Bertrand's seven
meter dish. Frequency is approximately 2278.3587 MHz, with very little
observed Doppler shift. The carrier and first data sidebands are
clearly visible.

By 12 December 2003, Bertrand's reception of the ACE spacecraft (see
above) improved to +13 dB SNR, as its elliptical orbit of the L1 point
moved it more than one degree above the Sun, as viewed from
Earth.

NOAA has arranged for the transmission of a subset of data from four
ACE instruments during the times when ACE is not transmitting it's
full telemetry to the Deep Space Network. For about 21 of 24 hours per
day, ACE will send data (~464 bps) to NOAA operated ground
stations. During the other three hours when NASA is getting high rate
data through the Deep Space Network, NOAA will get a copy of the real
time data.

http://www.srl.caltech.edu/ACE/ASC/DATA/pdf_docs/ACE_Spacecraft_SSR.pdf</a>

Telemetry transmission:

There are three selectable downlink data rates: 434 bps, 6944 bps, and
 76 384 bps. The pulse code modulation is bi-phase-L. The downlink
 data streams are encoded by the C&DH subsystem before they are routed
 to the transmitter. The coding consists of a convolutional code (7; )
 concatenated with a (248 217) Reed-Solomon code. The data stream is
 directly phase modulated onto the 2278.35-MHz downlink carrier,
 producing a residual carrier and data sidebands. The modulation index
 is selectable (high/low) by ground command. The low modulation index
 is required for transmitting the 434-bps data, and the high
 modulation index is used for the 6944-bps and 76 384-bps data rates.

Pointing at Earth:

 Angle between the observatory Z axis and the Earth observatory line
 is within +-3 deg , to stay within the required beamwidth of the
 high-gain antenna.  Angle between the Sun Earth line and the
 observatory Earth line is >= 5 deg, to limit the solar noise contribution
 to the receiving system noise temperature

RF Communications Subsystem:

The primary function of the RF communications subsystem is to serve as
the observatory terminus for radio communications between the
observatory and the NASA Deep Space Network of Earth stations. A
secondary function is to transmit downlink data in real time, at 434
bps, to Earth stations supporting the NOAA Real Time Solar Wind
project. The system is designed to receive uplink commands and
transmit downlink telemetry data concurrently with coherent
ranging. The system operates at 2097.9806 MHz for the uplink and
2278.35 MHz for the downlink.

Antennas 

The purpose of the broad-beam antennas is to provide hemispherical
uplink coverage forward and aft of the spacecraft. The broad-beam
antennas also provide sufficient gain in the region +- 34 deg off
boresight for the transmission of 434 bps data to a DSN 26-m ground
station.  The broad-beam antennas provide right circularly polarized
coverage (gain) over a hemisphere.

<a href="http://sec.noaa.gov/ace/acetrack_6h.html">
http://sec.noaa.gov/ace/acetrack_6h.html</a>

To an observer looking up from the Earth ACE appears to slowly circle
the Sun as it follows its orbit around the L1 libration point, about
1.5 million kilometers out from the Earth on the Earth-Sun line. To
obtain continuous data from ACE, SEC relies on a network of ground
tracking stations located at various sites around the world. All
stations, except for Boulder, use at least a 10 meter diameter
parabolic antenna to receive the extremely weak S band radio telemetry
signals from the 5 watt transmitter on the ACE spacecraft.

SOHO
====
When orbiting L1 between the Earth and the Sun the spacecraft can
enjoy an uninterrupted view of the Sun, the heliosphere, and the solar
wind particles. One L1 orbit takes about 6 months.

<a href="http://www.issfd.dlr.de/papers/P1064.pdf">
http://www.issfd.dlr.de/papers/P1064.pdf</a>

Because of solar radio interference constraints, SOHO is required to
avoid the region within 4.5 degrees of the Sun called the Solar
Exclusion Zone (SEZ).

The cruise to Pluto-Charon is designed to minimize spacecraft risk and
mission operations cost. To this end, some 41 days after Jupiter C/A,
the spacecraft will be placed into spin-stabilized, beacon-cruise
mode. Brief DSN contacts to monitor beacon status tones are planned
weekly. A nearly 2-month operational checkout and navigation/tracking
period is planned annually.

...  

To monitor beacon hibernation status, we will listen to the downlink
carrier once a week. One of two carrier frequencies are downlinked to
indicate status of spacecraft health (status: red or green). Ninety
minutes of DSN time is budgeted for each beacon hibernation mode
contact, with 20 minutes of pre- and post-calibration, 25 minutes for
tone detection, and 45 minutes of contingency. In the event of an
offnominal tone, the mission operations team will be activated for
contingency operations.

The GEOTAIL mission is a collaborative project undertaken by the
Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) and the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Its primary objective is
to study the dynamics of the Earth's magnetotail over a wide range of
distance, extending from the near-Earth region (8 Earth radii (Re)
from the Earth) to the distant tail (about 200 Re). The GEOTAIL
spacecraft was designed and built by ISAS and was launched on July 24,

Herschel & Planck

From amateur DSN (May 2009), thomas_ormston:

Both spacecraft to be stationed at L2.

The nominal D/L carrier for Herschel should be 8468.5 MHz
and Planck should be on 8455.0 MHz (accurate to within 1kHz).

Both spacecraft are Right-Hand Circular polarised signals. Telemetry
(unless on very low rate) is modulated directly onto the carrier. GMSK
modulation is used for the highest rate TM and PCM/SP-L modulation is
used for the lower rate.  Ranging tones should be at 698260 Hz.

with peaks at +/- 125 kHz - transmissions not very frequent and seem to 
be confined to 634 MHz - most likely on passes over eastern Europe - 
watch out for the Doppler shift at this frequency - it can make the 
signal appear up to 15 kHz off-frequency

628.000 630.000 AM
     Telemetry from Zvezda module, transmissions are similar to, and 
more frequent than those from Zarya and are on command from Moscow - the 
two transmitters appear to operate in parallel

922.76 CW
     Beacon from Soyuz-TM and Progress M1 and from the Russian ISS 
modules - tends to be received in parallel with the 166 MHz or 620-630 
MHz transmissions, beware of the Doppler, it ranges +/- 23 kHz from the 
centre frequency
