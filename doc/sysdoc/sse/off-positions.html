Requirements:

1. Assume a minimum pointing separation, e.g., 2 synthesized 
beamwidths.

2. All of the ON positions must be avoided by the minimum separation.

3. All of the OFF positions must be at least the minimum separation
apart.

4. None of the OFFs may go outside the primary FOV (3 dB down).

5. Very low or high declination targets must not be allowed to 
overlap in RA.


Preference order for choosing OFF positions:

1. The first choice for the OFF position is to use the time since the 
previous observation, along with the earth's sidereal rotation rate,
to determine the RA that would put the beam back in the orientation
it had during the previous ON observation (i.e., move east, toward
increasing RA, from the original pointing position).

Note that the rotational angular velocity of the earth
is ~ 0.25 degrees per minute, so it won't take long to
move outside the primary FOV. 

2. If the first choice fails any of the requirements,
try these directions, in this order:

  a. south (decreasing dec).
  b. north (increasing dec).
  c. west (decreasing RA).
  d. east (increasing RA).
  e. any open position in the primary FOV that meets all the
     requirements.
