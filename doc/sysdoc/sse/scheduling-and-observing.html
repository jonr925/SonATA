<h3>Scheduling and Observing Modes</h3>
<pre><b>
Determining primary beam pointing and synthesized beam
target selections:

Prelude acts as the primary observer in the user, semiauto,
auto, and autorise target modes; i.e., Prelude points the
primary beam.  In the commensal mode, Prelude uses the
current ATA primary beam pointing.

Target selection mode: user | semiauto | auto | autorise | commensal

   user:
      primary pointing: user act params (targetId or ra/dec)
      synth beam targets: user act params (targetIds)

   semiauto:
      primary pointing: user act params (ra/dec only)
      synth beam targets: autopick
   
   auto:
      primary pointing: autopick
         options:
         1. Use primary beam position preassigned to first
            chosen target (survey mode)
         2. Use first chosen target's coordinates as primary beam center 
         3. Choose primary beam position by TBD method

      synth beam targets: autopick

   autorise:
      same as auto, except targets are chosen near rising

   commensal:

      Another ATA user selects the primary pointing, but is expected to
      maintain that primary position for at least 1/2 hour, long
      enough for prelude to do a full followup sequence.

      primary pointing: from current tscope subarray position in 
         telescope status.  Must wait if slew is in progress
         (i.e., tscopes must be tracking).

      synth beam targets: autopick

      Prelude coordinates primary FOV change with the primary user,
      delaying the change as needed if a candidate is being followed up.
      It may have to abandon followups if the FOV changes
      earlier than desired.  (This could also be a preliminary operating
      mode before the primary beam FOV negotiation mechanism is in place).

   sched (scheduler)
      target: method used to choose targets (user | semiauto | auto |
         autorise | commensal) 

   act (activity)
      pointprimary: point primary beam (on | off) 
      primarybeampos: primary beam pointing position type (targetid | coords) 
      primarydecdeg: primary beam pointing position Dec degrees {j2000 degrees}
      primaryrahours: primary beam pointing position RA hours {j2000 hours}
      targetbeam[N]: SETI target id for beamN {SETI target id} {N=1,6}
      targetprimary: target id at the primary FOV center {target id}
