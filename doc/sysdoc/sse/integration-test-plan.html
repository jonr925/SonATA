</head>
<body>

<ol>
<p><li> Test all NSS components
<ul>
<li> Test baseband conversion of fielded IF chain
<li> Test operation of 3rd IF chain
<li> Verify baselines on all pdms (look for all known failure modes)
<li> Verify polarity on all signal paths
<li> Check that the test signal is seen on all pdms, in both pols
<li> Verify that there is no test-signal cross-talk 
<li> Test X-Y to L-R (circular) polarity conversion
<li> Verify that all UPSs are operational
<li> Confirm that all pdms have the correct software version
<li> Verify that all Prelude computers have good NTP time reference
<li> Verify that there is only one 'pps' program running on each pdm network.
</ul>

<p><li> Test ATA backend ASCII control interface
<ul>
<li> Verify all commands
<li> Try all pointing coordinate systems, verify min/max coordinate limits
<li> Check that all fields in status reports are within range and reasonable
<li> Check error handling for invalid commands
</ul>

<p><li> Test Tunings
<ul>
<li> Does Prelude need to invert (flip) the frequency band in the PDM or IFC (N/A to baseband system?)
<li> Verify that the full receiver frequency range can be accessed (0.5-11.2 GHz)
<li> Look at Hydrogen, various satellites & probes
<li> Ask Hat Creek to radiate signals at various precise frequencies, and
confirm that they are seen as expected.
<li> Test that the full IFP->D/A output band can be seen (~104 MHz wide?) (Is this possible?  Is Prelude IF at a fixed offset in the D/A band?)
<ul>
<li> Step pdms along the entire bandwidth
</ul>
</ul>

<p><li> Test synthesized beams
<ul>
<li> Verify that all beams have the same sensitivity
<li> Point 2 beams at the same point source, verify they see both it.
<li> Move one beam away from the source in increments, measure how the signal gain falls off.
<li> Determine minimum target separation needed to separate 2 beams for the maximum expected potential ET signal strength.
<li> Point a beam far outside the primary FOV
<li> Test pointings with 3 beams.
<li> Verify that Prelude is computing the correct beam sizes for the primary and synthesized beams.

</ul>

<p> <li> Verify signal gain provided by using the collecting area of multiple telescopes
<ul> 
<li> reobserve spacecraft & satellites already detected with single dish
<li> attempt to observe spacecraft too weak to detect with a single dish
<li> natural masers
</ul>

<p><li> Verify Prelude Configuration
<ul>
<li> Antenna Hour Angle Limits (database table)
<ul>
<li> Try pointing the telescopes to the extreme elevation limits at various azimuths.
<li> check target visibility (rise/set) (ATA vs Prelude) for various positions
</ul>
<li> Verify ATA site long, lat, altitude (database table)
<li> Check validity of target catalog positions (gal survey, habcat)
<li> Determine Prelude IF attn offset tables, based on frequency
</ul>

<p><li> Validate Tape Backup System
<ul>
<li> Save some files to tape, recover them, do bit compare
<li> Verify that all appropriate files are being saved:
<ul>
<li> system & error logs
<li> signal files
<li> full database (signals, obs history, etc) (TBD: hot backup? or system downtime scheduled?)
</ul>
</ul>

<p><li> Validate Archive Disk Rotation

<p><li> Validate recent RFI, permanent RFI, and birdie masks
<ul>
<li> Make sure they are being created and applied correctly
<li> For recent RFI, verify that the mask elements age off correctly
<li> Also verify that all targets that fall inside the synthesized beam
are excluded from the recent RFI mask.
</ul>

<p><li> Birdie Scans
<ul>
<li> Prelude Baseband 
<li> ATA IF1
<li> Where possible, track down birdie source and eliminate
</ul>

<p><li> Permanent RFI scans

<p><li> Determine signal detection thresholds for observing
<ul>
<li> Pulse
<li> Cw Power
<li> CW coherent (primary & secondary)
</ul>

<p><li> Determine minimum multibeam pointing separation needed for "Offs"
to have desired sensitivity falloff for expected signal strengths.

<p><li>Test remote console & power cycle control 
<ul>
</ul>

<p><li> Determine how effective multibeam observing is, in eliminating RFI.
<ul>
<li> What percentage of the RFI is eliminated?
<li> Are separate OFF observations required?
</ul>

<p><li> Test Multibeam candidate followup sequences
<ul>
<li> Point one beam on sky target, one beam off, make sure candidate signal continues to be tracked through entire followup sequence.
<li> Test that the followup sequence is followed correctly if signal is detected or not detected at each step
<li> Verify that single beam mode (with full followup sequences) still works
</ul>

<p><li> Verify automated observing. Check that:
<ul>
<li> Prelude starts up and shuts down at the correct times.
<li> The overall system watchdog restarts Prelude if the latter fails.
<li> The daily report is being sent at the appropriate time. Check contents for validity.
<li> Automated email is sent when the system cannot continue observing.
<li> Automated email is sent if an "interesting" signal is being observed.
<li> Tape backups & archive disk rotations do not interfere with observing,
and that observing does not adversely affect (e.g., corrupt) backups.
<li> Candidate signals are being archived as expected.
</ul>

<p><li> Scheduling.  Verify that:
<ul>
<li> Sun, Moon avoidance angles are being enforced
<li> Reasonable targets are being selected
<li> Target merit factors are being applied correctly
<li> Target catalogs are set up such that there is always at least one target in the primary FOV for each beam for every observation
<li> Verify target frequency coverage is reasonable.
</ul>

<p><li> Remote monitor & control interface.  Verify that:
<ul>
<li> All needed commands can be sent
<li> All needed data products can be accessed
</ul>

<p><li> Verify sufficient system resources are available on sse machines as Prelude runs
<ul>
<li> memory
<li> disk space (archive files, database files, ...)
<li> network bandwidth internal to HC
<li> network bandwidth from HC to offsite observers at MV, etc.
</ul>

<p><li> Review Post Detection protocol
<ul>
<li> Test as many of the steps as possible
<li> Verify that all needed resources are identified (equipment, contact info, etc).
</ul>
