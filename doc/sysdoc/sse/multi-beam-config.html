<H3>Multi-beam Configuration</H3>
<br>
The Prelude System is designed to observe with 2 or more beams
looking at a different target with each beam. In the multitarget
observing mode the primary candidates from each beam are
sent to the pdms on the other beams for verification. These
secondary candidates are tested for coherent confirmation.
If a candidate is seen in multiple beams, it is considered
RFI. If not seen, it remains a candidate.
<br><br>
The Prelude System Configuration of resources is contained in the
expected components file.
The current version of the file may be found in
<pre>
/home/nss/sse_release/setup/expectedNssComponents.cfg
</pre>
A typical file shows the Whisman Lab System as beams 1 and 2,
using ifc1 and tscope3, <br>and the Field System as beams 3 and 4, using ifc2 
and tscope1 and tscope2. <br>The pdms are allocated to beams 
according to which physical rack they are in.

For the Whisman Lab Configuration, the system should be started
with the following command line options:
<pre>
sse2:/home/nss> runsse -lab -ifc1only
</pre>
Beams 1 and 2 should be on
<pre>
seeker> sched set beam1 on
seeker> sched set beam2 on
</pre>
To run in multi-beam mode where primary candidates are passed
to pdms on the other beam as secondary candidates, turn on the 
multitarget parameter.
<pre>
seeker> sched set multitarget on
</pre>
For the Hat Creek Field Configuration, the system should be started
with the following command line options:
<pre>
sse2:/home/nss> runsse -ifc2only
</pre>
Beams 3 and 4 should be on
<pre>
seeker> sched set beam3 on
seeker> sched set beam4 on
seeker> sched set beam1 off
</pre>
