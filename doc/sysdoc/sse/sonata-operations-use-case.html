Operations use-case for automated SETI observations with SONATA:

1. The Sonata system runs automatically and
  autonomously as much as is possible.  When manual
  intervention is needed, it's done via remote access
  whenever practical, to minimize need for on-site staff.

2. The system runs targeted sky observations 24 hours per day,
  7 days per week.  Sonata has 2 of the 4 ATA IF Processors
  assigned to it.

3. If an observation activity fails for any reason, 
  the system tries to correct the error and automatically 
  resume observing.  Similarly, if any single component
  fails, like a pdm, the system tries to automatically
  restart it.  Failing that, the system tries to continue observing
  without the component, if possible.  The system always tries to 
  run with as much observing bandwidth as it can.

4. The system periodically runs a system diagnostic to make
  sure everything is working correctly, taking corrective 
  action when necessary, as described above.

5. The system generates a daily observing summary, which is
  sent by email and/or posted on an intranet web site.  The
  summary includes activities completed, targets observed,
  signal counts, system errors, equipment status, etc.

6. The system allows for remote observer monitor & control,
  via the Web and/or client programs.  The observer can:

  - display current equipment status
  - display waterfall & baseline data on demand
  - review signal reports displayed in a user-friendly format
  - power cycle/restart any piece of equipment
  - designate any piece of equipment as operational or
      nonoperational
  - override daily automated startup and shutdown
  - force system or component shutdown
  - assume full manual control of the system
  - run alternate observing programs, eg, targeted search of 
      specific object(s)
  - run diagnostics
  - review system logs


7. The system provides near-realtime status & data displays
  accessible to the general public, via the Web:

  - skymaps & target information for current pointings in RA/Dec,
      Gal Lat/Long etc.
  - progress indicators (e.g., skymaps, progress bars) showing how
    much of and which parts of the sky have been observed.
  - some subset of the waterfall & baseline data, ideally showing
      detected signals whenever possible, rather than random data.
  - webcam images of the telescopes

8. The system notifies observers by email and autodialer when
   it's tracking a "very interesting signal", i.e., one 
   that has passed the preliminary gauntlet of tests, such
   as three ON/OFF observations in a row.

   The system continues ON/OFFs and automatic grids until the target
   sets or an observer intervenes.
 
   For discussion: 

   - What series of tests defines a "very interesting signal"? 
   - What else happens when one is found?

   - Review & revise Jill's Arecibo "Post Detection Protocol at a 
   Glance" document for use at the ATA.  Main change will be to see
   if we can get a differential Doppler measurement across the array.

   - Note: It's suggested we not use pagers in order to save money.

9. The system notifies observers by email when it is in an error state
   that it can't recover from and so cannot continue observing, or
   when a significant percentage of the observing capability has been
   lost.  If this occurs in the middle of the night, then someone
   would take action on it within some reasonable time frame,
   presumably the next day.

10. An independent watchdog system sends notification by
   email if the Sonata system is not running when it
   should be, or if it's running but not behaving correctly.

11. A simple "panic button" can be initiated on-site or remotely
   to safely shutdown the system immediately.

12. The system avoids all the artificial horizons around strong 
  satellite sources, determined prior to each observation.

13. Periodically archive tapes must be manually taken out of
   the tape jukeboxes and new ones installed.
