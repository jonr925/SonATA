Prelude Data Forwarding(filesender/filereceiver)

</HEAD>
<BODY>

<pre>

The Prelude filesender/filereceiver programs can be used to forward
baseline and waterfall (complex amplitude) data from a remote system
to a local display in real-time.  This avoids the overhead of trying
to send the baseline and waterfall program graphics directly.

Example use:

Say the Prelude system is running on the remote host sse3,
and you want to forward the waterfall and baseline data for 
pdms 14 and 17 to a local host, sse1.


1. First log on to the receiving host (sse1 in this case),
and cd into the directory used by the prelude system to store
the baseline and waterfall files as they are collected:

  % ssh sse1 -l nss
  % cd sse_archive/confirmdata

2. Start the filereceiver program:

  % filereceiver

It will wait for connections from the file sender program.

3. Now log onto the host running the prelude system (in this case, sse3),
as the nss user, and again change to the appropriate archive directory:

  % ssh sse3 -l nss
  % cd sse_archive/confirmdata

4. Start the filesender program, specifying which files you
want to start sending.  For example, to send the baseline and
waterfall (complex amplitude) files for pdm14's left
pol, and both pols of pdm17, you would say:

  % filesender --host sse1  pdm14-L* pdm17*

5. Back on the receiving host, start the waterfall and baseline
programs as usual.  Select the desired pdms in the gui
in the usual way.  If this is the first time that data for
a pdm is being forwarded, you'll have to wait until some data
actually arrives before these programs will let you select
that pdm.

6. Start the (remote) prelude system.  The data should be forwarded 
automatically to the receiving host and displayed in the baseline and
waterfall programs as it's collected by the SSE.

7. When you're done, use control-C on each of the filesender and
filereceiver programs to terminate them.  

8. If the filesender loses it's connections for any reason
(error messages will appear), you can just control-C it and
rerun it.  It should re-establish connections with the
filereceiver.
