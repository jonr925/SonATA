sonata git account
2010/01/05

Today Tucker set up an account for sonata on repos.

I created public and private ssh keys for sonata 
on handel in the ~/.ssh directory. I copied the keys to 
mozart, chopin, brahms, schubert, and liszt.

I created repositories on each the hosts with the command

git clone git@repos.seti.org:/git/OpenSonATA.git

Further updates can be accomplished with pull and push.
