# setiquest-data-replay
2010-12-09 jj

Here are the instructions for replaying the data collected by 
Setiquest/SetiData. 

This test environment is set up to use haydn, handel, liszt, and brahms.
The multicast addresses and port numbers have been set so they 
do not conflict with the observing system.

The Setiquest/SetiData files are created from a channel
from the SonATA channelizer. The channelizer is configured to produce
16 channels that have a bandwidth of 6.5 MHz. With oversampling the
actual bandwidth of the channel is 8.7381333 MHz. But only 6.5 MHz 
is usable. The data are in 
channel packet format, i.e. 16 bit real and imaginary data values,
1024 per packet plus a channel packet header. This data is posted
on Amazon with the packet headers removed and the data values converted
to 8 bit real and imaginary.

In order to replay the data through SonATA, the data must be converted
to beam format packets, i.e. 8 bit real and imaginary, 2048 per beam
packet, with the appropriate adjustments to the packet header.

**** I can't find the instructions on how to run Rob's program that
does the conversion. Please insert here. ******

At the moment, haydn has room on its disk, but it's not a big disk. 
So the data files cannot be stored there permanently.

In a window on your local computer:

> ssh -X sonata@haydn.csr.seti.org

haydn> scr

haydn> source setiquest-env-vars

haydn> runsse

seeker> source setiquest-12dxs.tcl

seeker> start obs

-------------------------------------------
In another window:

>ssh -X sonata@haydn.csr.seti.org

haydn> scr

haydn> runpacketsend-setiquest

-------------------------------------------
=========================================================
runpacketsend-setiquest is set up to run 
~/2010-05-07-galanticenter-2-merged-1-of-3.dat 
which is the only one stored on haydn at the moment.

# runpacketsend-setiquest
sudo packetsend -J 228.1.50.1 -j 50100 -f ~/2010-05-07-galanticenter-2-merged-1-of-3.dat -n 1 -i 1000 -b 10
