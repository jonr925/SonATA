Additional Test Procedures:

	Vary the baseinitaccum from 1 to 20 to determine the minimum
		accumulation required.

	Determine average baseline power. Set appropriate limits for 
		warnings and errors.

	Check power coming out of the packetizers. 
		Compare beamformers using Channelizer Statistics.

	Correlate number of missed packets with system configuration.

	Run RFI Scans, SonATA and Prelude, Single Antenna
		1000 MHz to 9000 Mhz
		Compare detection results

 	Determine signal detection thresholds for observing
	Pulse, Triplet, CW Power, CW coherent (primary & secondary)	

	Collect statistics on Multibeam RFI rejection.
