<h4>
Package Dependencies for the SonATA </h4>
<h4>
Dependencies for
SSE (Search System Executive) package, which controls the SonATA</h4>
<p>
(The SSE package is known to build with the specified versions,
later versions may also work in many cases):
<p>gcc 4.3.2, 4.3.3
<p>automake 1.8.4
<p>autoconf 2.59
<p>libtool 1.5.6
<p>m4 1.4
<p>ACE (ADAPTIVE Communication Environment) 5.3, 5.5.1, 5.6.1
<p>java 1.4.2, 1.5.0
<p>tcl 8.3, 8.4
<p>mysql 4.1.7, 4.1.10, 5.0.22
<p>swig 1.3.21, 1.3.31
<p>expect 5.26
<p>gnu readline (2.2, 5.2)  -- needed for tclreadline
<p>xtail
<p><h4>The following libraries are available from the SETI Inst CVS server:</h4>
<p>tclreadline 9.9.0 (use for command line editing in the seeker)

<p><h4>Optional packages:</h4>
<p>CppUnit 1.5 (unit testing) - available from SETI CVS server
<p>doxygen 1.2.10 (creating automated documentation)
<p>stlport 4.6.2 (debugging STL related problems)
<p>pp3, tex, ImageMagick (making starmaps)
<p>Apache Tomcat 5.0.28 (for web control/monitor interface)

<p>Note:
<p>These libraries are included in the sse-pkg source tree:
<p>aaplusLib
<p>novasLib
<p>wcsLib


<h4>Build tools:</h4>
<p>All the normal tools (autoconf, automake, etc.), but any modern
distribution will provide an acceptable version of those.

<p>We strongly recommended gcc-4.3.3, because it generates noticeably
faster code than older versions, and versions much older than 4.2.3
will probably not support the vector instructions used.

<p>If you want to build and install gcc-4.3.3, you'll need gmp-4.2.4 and
mpfr-2.4.0.

<h4>Signal Processing Libraries:</h4>
<p>fftw-3.2.1
