Open SonATA future Functionality Wish List

General:
	- Fully Document System as Implemented

Control System - SSE

   - Scheduler:
        - better algorithm for reobserving "fully observed" targets
        - add rule: select second etc. beam targets that have
              approximately the same unobserved freqs as the first target
        - add rule: if first selected target has no nearby targets
              for additional beams, then try another first target
        - HPBW grid followup on candidate
        - review/rework target merit factors
             - review/implement suggestions from Habcat paper
             - are new merit factors needed?
             - are different merit factor weightings needed?
        - add changes to support ecliptic search program
        - add check to verify all targets are in the primary FOV
        - adjust target visibility check to handle moving targets
        - add satellite RFI "avoidance zones"
        - fall back to single beam mode if that is all that's available
    - Rework sse-pkg to use modern CppUnit
    - Add wide null beams
    - Verify use of nulls (and that null-depth factor is appropriate)
    - implement commensal observing (Sonata as secondary observer,
         partially done)
    - Determine if there are any scaling issues handling hundreds of DXs
    - Determine if there are any scaling issues handling > 42 ants
    - Publicly viewable near-real-time observing info on targets etc.
          (partially implemented)
    - periodic automatic system tests (test signal, spacecraft)
    - archive all candidates in followups
    - email/texting/autodialing notice of potential ET candidates
    - improve quality of frequency calibrations
    - automatic recalibration after N hours without obs restart
    - more efficient use of beams and DXs for followups (only use
         as many as needed)
    - automatically convert ATA observing schedule into automated
         system startup & shutdown (use alternative to cron?)
    - log all errors in the database
    - log ants used in the database
    - add watchdog to automatically restart SSE if it fails
    - continue development of Web UI prototype to make it fully
         functional, or develop other new remote interface
    - Add mechanism for Sonata to be easily enabled/disabled by staff
        at HC (mainly to control rogue actions)
    - add circular pol beam calibration control code
    - review and refine daily obs reports
    - add mechanism to mark observations as invalid in the database
    - rework how "bad ant pols" are specified - make a user parameter?
    - document how to build & verify the sse-pkg using stlport
    - consider sharing target catalogs among observing databases
         to reduce space
    - consider changing dark sky array pointing for bf autoatten
        from az/el 330,30 to dark[0,6,12,18] hours RA
    - use common prefix for all SSE env var names
    - tscope minDishSuccessPercent (# dishs allowed to fail) should be
         configurable
    - create a utility program to convert equatorial/galactic coords
    - add option to disable birdie masks in activities (e.g., for
         observing spacecraft)
    - change the calibration strategies so that the permanent RFI
         mask is taken into account when selecting frequencies
    - automatically verify calibration quality
    - make order of followup sequences configurable at runtime
        instead of being compiled into the seeker.

Configuration
    - determine appropriate thresholds & other configuration values for
         all cw & pulse related observing parameters
    - determine appropriate calibration integration times for entire
       1 - 11 Ghz band
    - validate minimum beam separation

Signal Processing

	- New types of signals for packetgen
	- New algorithms for new signals
	- Sum of polarizations for CW detection
	- Wide band CW signals
	- Full bandwidth Coherent Detector
