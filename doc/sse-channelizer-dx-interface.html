Channelizer & DX 
Communications, Configuration, Control & Monitor

0. Sonata directories

   Software installation:
   Default:
      ~/sonata_install/
         bin/ setup/ filters/ lib/

      Can be overridden by:
      ${SONATA_ROOT}

   Data products:
      ~/sonata_archive/

1. Channelizer

   Data stream input: Unicast from Sonata beamformer
   Data stream outputs: Multicast to DX

   Startup parameters from configuration file and/or
   command line parameters (relatively static values):

      - channelizer ID (name and/or number?)

      - filter parameters
          - coefficients file (includes associated number of foldings)
                [select by full pathname (nominally $SONTATA_ROOT/filters)]
          - number of foldings (until can be extracted from coeff file info)

      - input stream related:
          - IP address (w.x.y.z)
          - port
          - beam ID
          - polarization    
          - complex sample rate (Msamples/sec)

      - output stream related:
          - number of raw output channels 
               (normally power of 2, default: 256)
          - number of usable output channels 
               (must be even, assumed symmetric, default: 176)
          - IP address 
          - base port
          - oversampling (%)

      - statistics (multicasted output)
          - reporting interval
          - IP addr 
          - port

      Note: starts generating output immediately upon startup.

   Input packet header contains:
        TBD

   Output packet header (for each channel) contains:   
        - channel ID
        - beam ID
        - polarization
        - channel center freq MHz
        - valid data bit(s)

   Intrinsics (report configuration) message to SSE (& others?):
      - number of output channels
      - beam ID
      - polarization
      - bandwidth MHz per channel (usable)
      - oversampling info 
      (TBD: add info on all input & output parameters)

   Control input (TCP from SSE)

      Commands:
      - input was retuned (new RF center freq MHz, sync at time X)
          
           Output stops upon receipt of command.
           Flush packet buffers.
           Sequence numbers restart at zero.
           Wait for input packet on or after time X to resume output. 

      - request intrinsics
      - shutdown
      - stop (taking data -- is this needed?)
      - request status(?)

   Monitor output (TCP)
      health/status
         "have started" message
          current state/status report
          tune freq
      TBD: errors, warnings
        Need to set limits for monitored values.
        (Note: Implement this later, do stats multicast first)

   Statistics (single packet, multicast at regular intervals)
      - network stats
         % dropped packets, missing packets, "wrong" packets, other?

      - I/O stats (struct: mean,stddev,min,max)
        (1) input
        (1) summarized output (across all channels)
        (NCHANS) output channels

   Notes:

   A. Synchronization of channelizers:

     - must be sync'd at the time sample level
     - packet sequence numbers must match on L & R pols
     - corresponding channels must have the same bandwidth, 
          center tune freq
     - must send to the same IP address
     - must use the same base port number

   B. Number of channels:
     Changing the number of channels will also change the bin
     widths, which will alter the statistics.  Therefore we seldom
     expect to do this.

2. DX

   Data stream input: Multicast from channelizer(s)
   Data products output: TCP to SSE
   Assume 1 channel per DX, with one or more DXs per host.

   Startup parameters from configuration file and/or
   command line parameters (relatively static values):

      - dx name (default: host name)
      - filter parameters
          - coefficients file (includes associated number of foldings)
          - number of foldings (until can be extracted from coeff file info)
      - input information:
        - IP addr
        - base port number
        - oversampling %
        - usable channel bandwidth MHz

   Control input (TCP from SSE)

      Act params:

        - channel to observe (0..NCHANS-1)
        - center freq MHz (as assigned by channelizer)
        - beam Id
        - pol selection: X | Y | L | R | Both X & Y | Both L & R
        - science data request
            - baselines on/off
            - compamps on/off
                compamps subchannel selection: by freq or subchannel number

        Note: actual input port computed (base port + channel number)

      Other per activity parameters:               
      - observation length (secs)
      - birdie masks (for this beam, both "RF" and "IF")
      - max # of candidates 
      - singlets pulse threshold (for reporting large single pulse hits)
      - doublets
      (review other pdm activity parameters, expect to keep most)      


   Monitor output (TCP to SSE)
      TBD

   Notes:
      - Uses most existing pdm commands
      - No more coherent segments
      - Requested start time is start of baselining
      - DC started message returns actual data collect start time (fractional second)
