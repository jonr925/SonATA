<h4>Hardware Requirements for SonATA</h4>
<h4>Full-up system of 176 channels and 3 beams</h4>

<p>
A Full-up system of 176 channels and 3 beams
 is 528 channels of DX. Assuming that each DX host can process
16 channels, that works out to 33 machines, plus 6 
channelizers, plus 3 spares.
Each machine would be the equivalent of a Dell R610.
So the ideal system would be 2 racks with 20 R610's each and the 
associated switches. 
<p>The specs for the R610 are:
<p> dual quad 2.53 E5540, 
<p> 24GB of RAM, 
<p> 80GB hard drive, 
<p> PCI Express for the 10 Gb cards in the Channelizers,  
<p> rack mount hardware 
<p>(~$4500 Qty 1).
So that works out to 42 boxes @ $4500  =  $189 K.
