packetgen

packetgen generates dual polarization ATADataPackets as either
multicast packets over the network or a disk file.  
The data are gaussian noise with optional continuous wave signals 
drifting in frequency.

There are two modes. The default mode is channel data, simulating the
output from the channelizer. The other mode is beam data, simulating
data from the beamformer.

For channel mode, the default IP address is 239.1.1.1 and the port is 10000. 
For beam mode, the default IP address is 226.0.0.1 and the port is 9999.

The default polarization is X and Y Linear. The same data is sent to both
polarizations.
The default number of packets is 10000.
The default wake up interval is 0, so that the packets are sent as fast as possible.
The default noise power is 1.0.
The default bandwidth is 104.8576 MHz which is appropriate for beam mode.
There is no default signal description ( snr, drift, frequency).
There can be multiple signals. The frequency parameter defines a new signal
with whichever snr and drift was last specified.

   -#	seed	seed for the random number generator that creates the
		gaussian noise.

   -a	ipAddr	IP Address for the multicast packets

   -p	port	Port for multicast packets

   -x		Set polarization to XLINEAR and switch to single pol mode

   -y		Set polarization to YLINEAR and switch to single pol mode

   -f	packetFilename	Filename for disk output. No network packets.

   -c channel	Channel number (if in channel mode)

   -s source	Type of packet format ( Channel=1 or Beam=0 ) 

   -C		Set polarization to Left and right circular 

   -b		Generate beam packets

   -l		Use lazy mode for marshalling data (default: false)

   -n	numberOfPackets	Number of packets to generate (default: 10000)

   -i 	wakeupInterval	Wait time between packets in microseconds (default: 0)

   -P	noisePower	Mean power if gaussian noise.

   -B	Bandwidth	Bandwidth of data stream (default:

   -S	snr		Signal to noise ratio of a signal

   -D   drift		Drift rate hz/sec of a signal

   -F 	freq		Frequency of a signal. -bw/2 <= freq <= bw/2

   -z   packetBurst	Number of packets to send after waking up
