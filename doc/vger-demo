	Voyager 1 demo - running on a single host
			assuming 1 channelizer, 1 dx

	~/OpenSonATA/scripts>  source spacecraft-demo-env-vars

		This sets up dx1000 to receive dual polarization data.

	~/OpenSonATA/scripts>  runsse

	seeker> source vger-demo.tcl

		This starts up packetsend in the background and
		sends dual polarization data directly to the dx.
		The script also does a "start obs".
		The channelizer does nothing, but has to be there
		to keep the SSE happy. You have to wait for 
		packetsend to finish before running another activity.

	You can scp the data file from my account on segin.
	I don't want to check it in because it's so big 624 MB.
