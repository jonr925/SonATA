Data Rates for SonATA
2009-11-04 jj

The total data rate out of each beamformer is 104.8576MHz, but
the usable digital bandwidth is 72 MHz. 

104.8576 MHz / 2048 samples/packets = 51,200 packets/sec

1 beam = 51,200 packets/sec*4144 bytes/packet*8 bits/byte*2 pol = 3.395 Gbps

There is only one connection from each beamformer to the 10GbE switch.
It carries both pols for that beamformer.

Each channelizer processes only one polarization from one beam.
The data rate going into each channelizer is half of 
the beamformer rate, 1.697 Gbs on a 10GbE connection.

Each channelizer reads the entire 104 MHz and applies a digital filter
bank (DFB) to create 256 400 kHz channels. A total of 176 channels are output;
80 channels that are outside the usable bandwidth are discarded 
(40 at each band edge). At present, the Dell R610 is capable of outputing
176 channels. The Sun X4150 can only output 72 channels.

Each channel is oversampled, having a bandwidth of .54613333 MHz.
Oversampling is reciprocal, so the bandwidth is 
	.4096 MHz / (1 - .25) = .546133333 MHz 
A new spectrum is produced every 192 samples.  

The output rate for each single pol channel is:

   .54613333 MHz / 1024 samples/packet = 533.33333 packets/sec
   533.3333 packets/sec * 4144bytes/packet * 8 bits/byte = 17.68 Mbs

Each Channelizer transmits 176 channels:

	176 * 17.68 Mbs = 3.11 Gbs

Each dual pol beam has a data rate of 6.22 Gbs.
The total for 3 dual pol beams is 18.67 Gbs.
This data rate necessitates having 3 10GbE connections
between the 10GbE switch and the fanout switches.

Input to the DX server is 1GbE. 
One Dx process receives and processes both polarizations for one channel.
A Dx server can run 12-24 Dx processes depending on the capacity of the Dx server.

Dual Pol channel data rate is 35.36 Mbs.

12 channels per dx host:   12 * 35.36 Mbs = 424.3 Mbs
16 channels per dx host:   16 * 35.34 Mbs = 565.76 Mbs
20 channels per dx host:   20 * 35.34 Mbs = 707.2 Mbs
24 channels per dx host:   24 * 35.36 Mbs = 848.64 Mbs
(24 is probably the absolute maximum we could hope for
over a single 1 GbE interface).
