<h3 align=center style='text-align:center'>SonATA Project Description</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>$Id: open-sonata-description-jt.html,v 1.7 2009/05/20 21:00:45 jane Exp $
</p>

<h3><u>Overview:<o:p></o:p></u></h3>

<p>The SonATA System is the first software-only incarnation of the SETI
Institute's search system looking for narrowband radio signals of
extraterrestrial origin. SonATA runs on general purpose computers, and replaces
previous generations of search systems that relied on custom hardware in order
to achieve the near-real time performance that is required. By implementing the
SETI search system in general purpose, commodity servers, it should be possible
for SonATA to benefit from future <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moore</st1:place></st1:City>&#8217;s
Law growth in processing power. SonATA will be able to upgrade its searching capacity
by future upgrades to its host computer cluster. </p>

<p>SonATA conducts two types of SETI observations: targeted searches of
selected &quot;Target Stars&quot; from a star catalog, or surveys of an area of
the sky using a grid of selected positions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Both search strategies attempt to
detect narrowband signals of extraterrestrial origin, while recognizing and discriminating
against any detected signals of terrestrial origin. &nbsp; The narrowband radio
signals may take the form of continuous or pulsed signals that may drift in
frequency over time. These classes of signals have been selected because it
does not appear that they can be produced by astrophysical emission processes,
but are easily generated by technology. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The
data are processed in near real-time in order to facilitate discrimination of
terrestrial signals by means of immediate, automated follow-up observations. </p>

<p>SonATA currently runs as a <span class=SpellE>bandlimited</span> version on
the ATA (Allen Telescope Array) and uses the multi-beam capability of the ATA
to target specific stars or survey directions. SonATA is designed to observe
with 2 or more beams looking at a different target with each beam. This multi-target
observing mode not only speeds up search, but it helps with radio frequency
interference (RFI) identification and discrimination. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>In general a candidate signal that is seen in
multiple beams, it is considered RFI that has been detected within the outlying
sidelobes of the phased-up beam patterns.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span></p>

<p>The ATA currently produces 4 <span class=GramE>dual-polarization</span> IF
channels with output digitized time series samples of voltage for a 104.8576 MHz
bandwidth each. SonATA uses <span class=SpellE>polyphase</span> filters to
break this input data stream into narrower channels, arranges for a 50% overlap
in time, and performs <span class=SpellE>FFTs</span> to generate spectral data with
a final resolution of 1 Hz, 2 Hz, or 4 Hz. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The spectral data are normalized and statistical
detection thresholds are set to achieve an acceptable probability of false
alarm from noise alone (and in practice, empirically modified to accommodate
the local interference levels). <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Efficient
CW detection and pulse detection algorithms process these spectral data,
arriving at 1.5 second frame intervals, identifying candidate signals, which
are then compared to candidates detected in other beams and with a dynamic database
of known RFI signals. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Data collection is
followed by signal detection and classification proceeding in a two-stage
pipeline that is constrained to complete on fixed observational boundaries. <span
class=GramE>Candidates that remain interesting after this first round of
discrimination filtering cause the pipeline to be interrupted and trigger
follow-up observations to determine whether the candidate is of
extraterrestrial origin.</span> <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p>A software executive program automatically selects the target stars (or
directions) and frequencies for each observation, synchronizes the start of new
data collection, and the processing of old data collected in the previous
observation, reviews the signal candidate classifications, and decides whether
to continue the pipeline process by selecting another frequency or target or
break the pipeline to begin <span class=SpellE>reobservation</span> and
automated follow-up. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The SETI Institute
team has had more than a decade of experience running the precursors of SonATA
on custom built hardware in configurations that invoked two widely separated astronomical
observatories functioning as a pseudo-interferometer for effective RFI
discrimination based on the predictable differential Doppler signature of
signals detected at the two sites. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>We
have only recently begun operating the partially-custom Prelude detection
system on the Allen Telescope Array, and are still learning how best to use the
multiple antennas of a true interferometer to help with RFI discrimination. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The software for SonATA has been demonstrated
on a small number of general purpose processors, while awaiting a cluster large
enough to process the full output bandwidth of the multiple phased-up beams
from the ATA. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<h3><u>System Components <o:p></o:p></u></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>ATA, Allen Telescope Array:</b> </p>

<p>The Allen Telescope Array (ATA) is a joint effort by the SETI Institute and
the Radio Astronomy Laboratory at the <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType>
of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">California</st1:PlaceName>, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Berkeley</st1:place></st1:City> to construct a Radio Interferometer
that will be dedicated to astronomical and simultaneous search for
extra-terrestrial intelligence observations. It is being built at the existing
Hat Creek Observatory, run by the Radio Astronomy Lab at <st1:City w:st="on">Berkeley</st1:City>,
and located in the Cascades just north of <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Mt.</st1:PlaceType>
<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Lassen</st1:PlaceName> (<st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">California</st1:place></st1:State>). </p>

<p>The ATA is being constructed in stages. The initial array has 42 six-meter
antennas and the final configuration will have 350 of these relatively small
antennas. An innovative feed and cryogenic receiver system on each antenna provides
continuous frequency coverage from 0.5 to 11 GHz.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This entire bandwidth is brought from each
antenna over fiber optic cables to the control building, and there as much of
the bandwidth as possible is digitized, with current-epoch ADCs (104.8576 MHz,
dual-polarization in 4 independent frequency channels today). <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The digitized signals received from individual
antennas are combined in two ways; to form a radio map or image of the entire
field of view of the array using a spectral-imaging correlator, and to form a synthesized,
full-resolution beam for pointing at a specific target on the sky using a phased-up
beamformer. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>There are four independent
IF tunings available at the ATA. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Today
two correlators are attached to two of the frequency tunings, and three
beamformers work from the other two tunings. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Eventually multiple beamformers and correlators
could populate <span class=GramE>all of the</span> IF tunings, if the
scientific case for such commensal observations is strong enough. The three
beamformers used by SETI currently each produce 104.8576 MHz bandwidth
dual-polarization beams. </p>

<p>In general either one astronomical survey or one SETI survey will control
the pointing of the array as the primary user, with other secondary users able
to access different IF tunings, correlators, beamformers, or other backend
processors for their observations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
is what is meant by commensal observing at the ATA; the direction on the sky
must be shared, but the multiple back end instruments and the frequency agility
of the array permit many different science programs to be conducted at one time
utilizing that same piece of sky.</p>

<p><b>SSE, Search System Executive, the Control Software:</b> </p>

<p>The Search System Executive (SSE) is the software that controls and
coordinates the SonATA equipment.&nbsp; The SSE will configure, control and
monitor all hardware in SonATA and all resources needed to conduct observations
and system tests. </p>

<p>The SSE Software operates on Linux. &nbsp; SonATA will be allocated two of
the RF tunings, and currently will use up to 3 dual-polarized beams. </p>

<p><b>Detector Chain:</b> The digitized 104.8576 MHz bandwidth data stream from
the ATA is formatted in IP Packets by the beamformers. There is a separate data
stream for each beam polarization. The polarization can be either X and Y linear
or Left and Right Circular Polarization, depending on the processing done in
the beamformer. </p>
<p> The channelizers and detectors are realtime systems and
        performance is critical.  Each
        channelizer is fed by a beamformer polarization with the
        data rate of 1.7 Gb/sec. Each channelizer channelizes
        the data with a DFB (Digital Filter Bank) and
        redistributes it within our system
        in ~176 channels data streams at the rate of ~18 Mb/sec each.
        There is a 2 stage signal processing pipeline consisting of
        data collection and signal detection/archiving. The second
        stage must complete in the same amount of time as it took
        to collect the data.

</p>
<p><b>Channelizer:</b> </p>

<p>There are one or two <span class=SpellE>channelizers</span> per beam
polarization depending on the capacity of the hosts on which they are running.
Each <span class=SpellE>channelizer</span> performs a 7-Folding DFB and a 256
point FFT on the input data to create channels that are 400 KHz in bandwidth.
The Channels are distributed using UDP Multicast protocol to the network where
the DX (signal detectors) subscribe to their assigned channel. </p>

<p><b>DX:</b> </p>

<p>Each DX will process 400 KHz of bandwidth performing a 50% overlapped in
time FFT for a 1.5 second frame. Multiple DX can execute on the same host
depending on the capacity of that host. The DX first <span class=SpellE>subchannelizes</span>
the input channel into 1 KHz bandwidth using a DFB and FFT. The <span
class=SpellE>subchannels</span> are further reduced to 1 Hz, 2 Hz, 4 <span
class=GramE>Hz, ...</span> Resolutions. The resolution data are formatted for
power and coherent continuous wave and <span class=SpellE>thresholded</span>
for pulse detection.The goal is to have one CW resolution of either 1 Hz, 2 Hz, or 4 Hz.
And  10 time-overlapped resolutions for Pulse Detection
(1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512 Hz)
plus a non-overlapped 1 KHz resolution. The number od resolutions processed
will depend on the capacity of the DX Host. The DX will also provide scientific data (baselines,
complex amplitudes), as well as detect and report signals, and filter the
signals with a recent RFI mask to select candidate ETI signals.&nbsp; <u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<h3><u>System Operation <o:p></o:p></u></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>System Configuration and Resource Allocation:</b> </p>

<p>The resources are allocated with a set of configuration files. All these
files are found in ${HOME}/<span class=SpellE>sse_release</span>/setup/
directory. The &quot;<span class=SpellE>expectedNssComponents.cfg</span>&quot;
file lists which <span class=SpellE>DXs</span> receive input from which beam
and <span class=SpellE>channelizer</span>. </p>

<p>A set of default parameters including observation length, thresholds, pulse
resolutions, etc. will be selected at this time. </p>

<p><b>Observing Schedule:</b> </p>

<p>A scheduler will create an observing schedule based on resource
availability, target visibility and observing strategy. Examples of observing
strategies include selecting targets nearest their rise time or targets that
are close to Earth in light years or targets with low declination or target
directions in the galactic plane that are at a sufficiently large angle from the Sun.
Typically, a database containing the observation history will be queried for
unobserved targets and frequencies. A set of 2 or 3 targets will be selected
within the primary field of view. The same set of center frequencies will be
assigned to <span class=SpellE>DXs</span> on each beam. Each DX will have the
same parameters with the exception of the frequency and target. </p>

<p><b>Preparing Antennas and Beamformers:</b></p>

<p> At the start of an observing session a subset of the antennas in the
array are selected, based on their system temperature and drive status.
The beamformers are initialized with this antenna
list, and a series of delay, phase, frequency, and polarization calibrations
are performed. 

<p>A pointing request for the position (RA<span class=GramE>,DEC</span>) of the
primary field of view (if SonATA is the primary user) along with the
coordinates of each of the synthesized beams and the RF tunings are sent to the
ATA telescope interface. The center frequency for the RF tuning is selected so
that all the DX frequencies fall within the RF bandwidth (104 MHz). </p>

<p><b>DX Initialization: </b></p>

<p>When a DX first connects to the SSE, it is sent two masks to be applied
during the observations. The Receiver Birdie Mask represents persistent signals
(1 <span class=SpellE>subband</span> bandwidth) that are generated within the
observatory IF Chain. The Permanent RF Mask represents sky frequency bandwidths
(usually in 400 KHz increments) with high occupancy RFI such as satellites,
ground based radar, airplane communication, etc<span class=GramE>..</span> For
each observation, these masks are adjusted for the current DX center frequency
and applied to the input data stream before signal detection is done. </p>

<p>For each observation, the DX will be sent observing parameters, the Recent
RFI mask and scientific data request for display/archive. The recent RFI mask
consists of noise and transient signals received within the last week that were
not seen on the current target. This mask will be applied to the detected
signals. </p>

<p><b>Data Collection:</b> </p>

<p>The start of data collection for all DX is synchronized using a 1 <span
class=SpellE>pps</span> time standard and a broadcast time of day generated by
the SSE. Preceding each observation, there is a period of baseline accumulation
(default 20 half-frames) to create the first baseline to be used for
normalizing the data. Baselines are calculated for each frame using 90% of the
previous frame's value and 10% of the current frame's value. </p>

<p>The DX will send science data for archiving and display to the SSE.
Baselines will be archived every TBD frames for all DX in both polarizations.
Complex Amplitudes will be 4 bits real and 4 bits imaginary. They will be
archived as requested. The archive/display data will remain at the site where
it was collected, unless the network is really fast. </p>

<p><b>Signal Detection:</b> </p>

<p>The <span class=SpellE>DXs</span> perform a power CW detection (DADD) and
pulse detection for 1 Hz resolution. The results from the two detectors will be
combined using a clustering algorithm that groups together signals that are
adjacent in frequency. A CW signal description is preferred over a pulse signal
description. The resulting Signal Descriptions will include RF frequency, drift
rate, power, RFI classification, detector type, signal width, detector bin
width, significance, SNR, etc. The recent RFI mask will be applied to these
signals to filter out previously seen RFI. All previous signals have been
written to the database with frequency, target, drift, power, date, etc. The
database is used as an RFI mitigation tool. Each signal detected is compared
against the most recently seen signals in the database. If a signal is matched
in the database, it is labeled as RFI. If not, the signal becomes a candidate signal.
The candidate signals and RFI signals are reported to the SSE and saved in a
relational database. Only the signals seen within the last week are used to
create the &quot;recent RFI&quot; mask. This mask is applied after signal
detection. Internal birdies, signals that are always present, will be masked
off before signal detection. RFI signals that are always present, Permanent
RFI, will also be masked off before signal detection. Recent RFI signals
(within a week) will be identified after signal detection and reported as RFI
so that the occupancy rate can be determined. </p>

<p><b>Candidate Selection:</b> </p>

<p>Signals which have not been seen before are reported as candidates. </p>

<p><b>Candidate Verification: Multi-beam Mode</b> </p>

<p>In Multi-beam mode, there are 2 or 3 <span class=SpellE>DXs</span> observing
the same frequency range, but with different target pointings or beams. The
beam separation is a user parameter. The default value is 5 synthesized
beam-widths, so that each beam can serve as an Off-source for the other beams. </p>

<p>The CW candidates are further processed by the coherent detection algorithm.
If the CW candidate passes the coherent probability of false alarm (PFA)
threshold, it is sent to the other <span class=SpellE>DXs</span> that are
observing the same frequency as a secondary candidate. Pulse Candidates are
also sent to the corresponding <span class=SpellE>DXs</span>. The secondary
candidates are analyzed by searching the confirmation data (complex amplitudes)
for an exact match in frequency and drift. A lower threshold for the coherent <span
class=SpellE>pfa</span> is used for secondary detections. </p>

<p>When a candidate is seen in 2 or more <span class=SpellE>DXs</span>, it is
classified as RFI. If a candidate is seen in only one DX, then it remains a
Candidate and a <span class=SpellE>followup</span> observation is scheduled. </p>

<p><span class=SpellE><b>Followup</b></span><b> Observations</b> </p>

<p>First, an ON Observation is scheduled. Each DX is initially sent a list of
the confirmed Candidates for the frequency and beam that it is observing. The
Candidates must appear within +- 100 Hz of the predicted frequency. If the
Candidates are not seen again, they are marked as RFI. If the Candidates are
reconfirmed, they are sent to the other <span class=SpellE>DXs</span> at the
same frequency for secondary confirmation as above. If a Candidate is seen on 2
or more <span class=SpellE>DXs</span>, it is marked as RFI. If a Candidate is
seen only on one DX, an OFF Observation is scheduled. </p>

<p>For the OFF observation, each DX is sent the list of confirmed Candidates
for the frequency and beam that it is observing. If the candidate is seen
off-source, it is marked as RFI. If a candidate is not seen off-source, another
ON Observation is scheduled. The <span class=SpellE>OFFs</span> do not exchange
candidates for secondary processing. </p>

<p>Alternating ON and OFF source Observations are scheduled as long as the
Candidate continues to be confirmed or until the source sets or an
observer/scientist intervenes. During the testing phase, there is a maximum of
4 on/off <span class=SpellE>followup</span> pairs, then normal observing
resumes. </p>

<p>The signal descriptions will be accessible from the database. The scientific
data will be accessible from the archive storage. </p>
