Automatic Starting of SonATA Components
2010-03-04 jj

The Expected SonATA Components must be specified in two separate
places. 

First, in ~/OpenSonATA/sse-pkg/setup/expectedSonATAComponents.cfg
all the components are assigned to a beam.
I am using the convention that all the dxs on beam 1 are named dx1nnn
and those on beam 2 are named dx2nnn.

TBD: Add Channelizer to Configuration File, NssComponentsTree, etc.

------------------------------------------


The second way that components are specified is by environmental
variables. This applies only to the dxhosts and dxs and the
channelizer hosts and channelizers.
Eventually, I would like to have a naming convention for the dx and
channelizer hosts, i.e. dxhost1,...dxhost24 and chanhost1x, ... chanhost3y.
(Or we can start with zero). The following variables must be defined.

setenv RUNSSE_DX_HOSTS  "dxhost1 dxhost2"
setenv DXHOST1 "haydn"
setenv DXHOST2 "chopin"
setenv DXHOST1_DX_NAMES "dx1001 dx1002 dx1003 dx1004 dx1005 dx1006"
setenv DXHOST2_DX_NAMES "dx2001 dx2002 dx2003 dx2004 dx2005 dx2006"

setenv RUNSSE_CHAN_HOSTS "chanhost1x chanhost1y chanhost2x chanhost2y"
setenv CHANHOST1X "handel"
setenv CHANHOST1X_NAME "chan1x"
setenv CHANHOST1Y "handel"
setenv CHANHOST1Y_NAME "chan1y"
setenv CHANHOST2X "brahms"
setenv CHANHOST2X_NAME "chan2x"
setenv CHANHOST2Y "liszt"
setenv CHANHOST2Y_NAME "chan2y"
setenv CHANOPTS "-C 256 -c 176 -N 10 -O 0.25 -B 104.8576 -d ../../filters/LS256c10f25o  -w 1 -F 1420.0 -n"
setenv CHANHOST1X_OPTS "-P X  -i 50000 -j 51000"
setenv CHANHOST1Y_OPTS "-P Y  -i 50001 -j 51000"
setenv CHANHOST2X_OPTS "-P X  -i 50002 -j 52000"
setenv CHANHOST2Y_OPTS "-P Y  -i 50003 -j 52000"
setenv CHANHOST3X_OPTS "-P X  -i 50004 -j 53000"
setenv CHANHOST3Y_OPTS "-P Y  -i 50005 -j 53000"

See ~/OpenSonATA/scripts/sonata-startup-env-vars


The runsse-test script picks the dx host names from RUNSSE_DX_HOSTS
and adds them to a list of components to be started automatically .
The list is sent to the controlcomponents-test script.

controlcomponents-test starts each component in the list.
For the dxhostN components, the script retrieves the actual host name 
and the list of dx names from the environmental variables.

The individual dxs can be restarted from the seeker command line.

control restart dxnnnn

The dxs are automatically restarted if they fall over.

The runsse-test script picks up the channelizer host names 
from RUNSSE_CHAN_HOSTS and adds them to the list of components to be
started automatically. In the controlcomponents-test script, the actual
channelizer host name and channelizer name are read from the environment 
variables.  There are 2 sets of options. One for all channelizers and 
another for the specific beam and polarization of each channelizer.

Also, you need to set up authorized_keys in your ~/.ssh directory
authorized_keys == id_dsa.pub.

and set your sudo to NOPASSWD: (sudo visudo)
