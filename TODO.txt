This is a list of things we need to do:

1) Get the installLibs script working. This attempts to install ALL necessary libraries
needed to build and execute SonATA. But the script needs work, testing.
2) Improve/re-write the install instructions in doc/linux-install-options.txt
3) Write instructions on how to demonstrate the system. How to run it on the voyager data and see the waterfalls and baseline.
